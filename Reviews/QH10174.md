## Summary
The manuscript 'Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits' focus on analyzing the problem of realizing resource-efficient approximate $t$-design with reduced circuit depth, by using a minimal-amount of non-Clifford resources. The manuscript has different interesting results, first and foremost that shallow Clifford circuits can be used to generate approximate Clifford circuits both in additive and approximate errors, and this result can be transferred to the notion of state-design. The manuscript then analyze the number of resources necessary to construct additive and relative approximate $t$-design, showing that such task if considering shallow Clifford circuit with constant depth circuits of non-Clifford gates, such tasks is possible efficiently with different architecture construction. They also show that if considering single-qubit non-Clifford gates the minimum number of single-qubit gates to use is $O(k^2)$. 

## Opinion
I think the paper deserve publication in PRX quantum after a small revision. The manuscript is well written, and offers new results that are quite of interests, they improve upon results on approximate $t$-designs. I would like to emphasize that I really appreciate the idea of reducing the complexity by using shallow Clifford circuits, although numerically there have been results on the use of shallow Clifford circuits to mimic the behavior of random Clifford circuits, al least by my knowledge this is one of the first rigorous theoretical results in that direction. The manuscript also offers interesting theoretical results in the field. I have just a few small comments on the results.

+ Did you analyze how the results hold when the generator of the Commutant becomes dependent so when $k>n-1$, how this affects the gluing results for the Clifford circuits, and then the results about approximate designs. In [37] there is an analysis at least in terms of the non-Clifford resources and this affects the circuit complexity? Do you expect it will affect also the approximate Clifford results. I think this is a relevant question considered the interests in constructing pseudorandom-unitaries and so something that behaves like a unitary $k$-design when $k$ scales faster than any polynomial in $k$.
