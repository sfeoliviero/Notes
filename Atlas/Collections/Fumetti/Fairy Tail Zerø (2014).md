  Long before she would found Fairy Tail, first master Mavis Vermillion is left under the care of the Red Lizard guild. Abused and belittled at every opportunity, she is forced to complete difficult chores.

However, her life of servitude comes to an abrupt end when the Blue Skull guild raids her home, leaving only Mavis and the guild master's daughter, Zera, alive.

  For many years, Mavis and Zera live alone, taking care of each other.
