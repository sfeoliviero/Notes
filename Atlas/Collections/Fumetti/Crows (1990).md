plot: |-
  Suzuran is a school where the misfits of society congregate. Known as Crows, the students lack a promising future; they establish their place in the world only by using their fists. In this violent culture, physical strength remains the be-all and end-all amongst teenagers with nothing else to live for. Suzuran maintains its set hierarchy, but such a system fails to unite all involved in a common goal. While there are those at the top, Suzuran has no single leader.

  Enter Harumichi Bouya, an unethical teenager with little intellectual capability. As a typical delinquent, Harumichi loves to fight and takes on any adversity with his physical prowess. Now at Suzuran, Harumichi aims to prove himself and reach the very top of the vicious society he has been thrust into.
