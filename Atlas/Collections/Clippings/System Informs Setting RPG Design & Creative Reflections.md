# Summary

- Game mechanics fundamentally dictate and expose a game's setting and genre expectations.
- Specific rules from games like OD&D, Black Void, and Savage Worlds are analyzed to demonstrate their impact on worldbuilding and narrative.
- The author critiques published adventure design, using Broken Compass as an example of linear, movie-script-like scenarios that often fail to account for player agency.
- A conceptual framework categorizes RPG elements into \\"Games,\\" \\"Puzzles,\\" and \\"Stories,\\" based on their mechanical complexity and narrative function.
- Personal reflections touch on the struggle for originality in creative work and the importance of authentic contribution to the RPG community.

# Key Rules / Features

-   **OD&D:** Charisma determines maximum hirelings; rules for Dwarf, Elf, Halfling characters versus human classes.
-   **Black Void:** Features tables for creature blood potency, divination ritual difficulties, and magical backlash severity. Includes a Crippling Injuries table with six states of physical health (Healthy to Dead), and separate tables for Awe, Delirium, Fear, and Madness effects. Characters gain benefits based on their homeworld, and have ~46 talents and ~46 flaws. Unique Attributes (e.g., Claws, Quick Healing) and Esoteric Attributes (e.g., True Vision, Regeneration) exist. An Enlightenment score measures cosmic understanding with associated Ascension benefits, and a Wastah score tracks faction influence.
-   **Broken Compass:** Uses a D6 dice pool system where successes are determined by matching dice (e.g., two-of-a-kind for Basic success, up to six-of-a-kind for Impossible tasks). Characters combine Fields (general aptitudes) and Skills (specific aptitudes) for rolls. Luck score functions as health. Luck Coins grant automatic Extreme Successes or avoid negative outcomes, are flipped, and given to the GM on Heads. Bad/Good Feelings act as conditions, providing Disadvantages/Advantages to rolls and canceling each other out.
-   **Savage Worlds:** Mechanically categorizes enemies into \"mooks\" (fodder) and \"bosses\" (more important foes), supporting a pulpy, high-action genre.
-   **ICRPG:** Obstacles and challenges (like chests or traps) have a \"Hearts\" value, which players reduce through actions (inspired by Zelda).
-   **Skull Mages (Concept):** Powerful mages, post-mortem, exist as sentient, telepathic skulls (due to forbidden pacts) that can teach magic. They are immobile and dependent on living carriers, serving as dynamic, demanding spellbooks/tutors.
-   **Games, Puzzles, Stories Framework:** Categorizes RPG narrative elements:
    -   **Games:** Elements with distinct mechanics, loops, and clear win/lose conditions (e.g., character stats, base upgrades).
    -   **Puzzles:** Situations with multiple solutions, solved narratively using character wits/equipment, without inherent emotional importance (e.g., overcoming dangerous locations, navigating complex social interactions).
    -   **Stories:** Elements driven by emotional payoff and character development, focusing on motivations, values, and the emotional impact of locations (e.g., character backgrounds, shared community experiences).
-   **\"Dungeons & Dragons\" Style Idea Generator:** A creative prompt suggesting taking two words that start with the same letter to create evocative game ideas (e.g., \\"Sonars & Stolichnaya\\").

## Content
![](https://cryptoftheramblingdead.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/default.jpg)

This is the cover of the “White Box” boxed edition of the original 1974 Dungeons & Dragons game, as I am sure you did not need telling. And you can probably see where this is going already.

The entire premise of the game is on the, admittedly, verbose cover. There are dungeons, there are dragons, it is a wargame set in a fantastical (not fantastic, as the cover says, which is a different thing, although the game is not all that bad. Whether its fantastic or not is another matter) medieval world. You are meant to play through campaigns, in the sense of going to war, and there are human wizards and short pointy eared creatures at the very least, according to the art (which are probably goblins, I guess).

That is indeed, what it is. There are other parts to it but it is a good distillation of what to expect. You are all familiar with the Appendix N heritage of the game, as well as the heritage of actual military wargames-come-hobby, so I won’t expound on those. But I want to take a closer look at the rules themselves and see what we can tell about the game world and the stories told within from just referencing those rules.

![](https://cryptoftheramblingdead.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png)

In OD&D, your Charisma score determines the maximum number of hirelings you can command. The game presents a table to work this out, as well as modifiers to how loyal those hirelings are to you. In this way, the game is not only setting the expectation that having a company of hired help is the intended experience, but that the game expects it to feature often enough across different play groups that a reference table is useful if not needed. This is backed up by the game marketing itself as a set of “rules for \[…\] wargames”, so we know it’s deliberate.

There are rules for playing as a Dwarf, Elf and Halfling, and each is better at some things and worse at others, as compared to human characters (Fighting-Men, Magic-Users, Clerics). The game expects such characters to feature often in games, so it has rules for them. And, once again going back to the cover, it describes the rules as being for wargames that are fantastic and medieval. Magic is fantastical – check. The technology set within the game (with swords and arrows, lanterns and carts, plate armour and torches) is indeed medieval – check.

These examples are the low hanging fruit, helped along by the description of the game on the cover. Let’s try something different now. I will list some mechanics – let’s see if you can guess the game or type of game from them.

---

1. A table for different levels of potency of a creature’s blood and how much harder but also more powerful it makes the bloodletting ritual it is used in
2. A table for different types of divination ritual and their difficulties, e.g. a Yes or No query, a guided query, an open query, etc.
3. A table of magical Backlash for both types of the above rituals, scaling in severity
4. A Crippling Injuries table and six different states of physical health – Healthy, Bruised, Hurt, Injured, Incapacitated, Dead
5. Separate tables of ~10 entries each for Awe, Delirium, Fear and Madness effects
6. Table of different benefits available to the character depending on their world of origin
7. Tables of ~46 talents and ~46 flaws for characters
8. Table of what the game calls Attributes: traits not found in humans, like Claws, Horns, Quick Healing, Night Vision and Additional Legs, with a separate table for Esoteric Attributes, like True Vision, Regeneration, Daimonic Whisper, Ageless or Reincarnation
9. An Enlightenment score for each character, which measures their understanding of the sheer vastness of existence, the grotesqueness of the Cosmos and the reality of the Void
10. A table of Ascension benefits one can achieve the closer they get to Enlightenment (see above)
11. A Wastah score for each character, which measures their standing, influence and “pull” with a given organisation, authority or group, one score for each such group

There’s a few things there to unpack.

1 and 2 speak on the kinds of magic that exist in the world.

3 and 4 show just how dangerous the world and its magic are, and that characters are, or at the very least can be, mentally and physically fragile (to an extent).

5 shows that the game features many scenes and creatures or things that can cause the player to have less agency over their character when certain emotions occur to them, which makes sense for the emotions mentioned, and reinforces a Horror genre.

So far you might be thinking this sounds like a low tech, maybe even archaic setting, given the blood ritual magic, of a horror inclination, given the focus on physical and mental harm and fragility. You wouldn’t be wrong, but let’s keep going.

6 is where it gets “interesting”, if it wasn’t already. To be clear, “worlds” in that sentence means literal worlds, or planets, i.e. “homeworlds”. A sci-fi trope in a game with blood rituals and divine incantations.

7 is less worldbuilding material and more genre, to show that it is important to the game to deep dive on each character’s personality, quirks and idiosyncrasies.

8 informs not only a quality of strangeness for the characters, but also reinforces the ideas of a horror genre and a dangerous world for the game.

9 and 10 go a little whacky in that they display that there is an inherent mystery to the way the world is, which is important enough that they necessitate mechanics for the characters that understand said mysteries, which means that understanding is power, if not also danger, for characters in this game.

And 11 shows that faction play and the motivations and drives of different groups and individuals are not only important enough to track, but also will probably clash at some point. Also, Wastah being an Arabic word, it tells us something of the setting as well.

There are more mechanics and tables I could talk about but I feel like this is a good selection to talk about this game as an example. The game, if you haven’t already guessed, is [Black Void](https://modiphius.net/collections/black-void) – a game where humanity went through a cataclysmic event during the early Bronze Age, the survivors of which were abducted by aliens and who now find themselves in a central interplanetary hub of cultures and peoples much like Planescape’s Sigil. You can see how, even from just the examples of rules and tables I outlined above, the setting starts to form: different homeworlds give you different benefits. The world is horrific and dangerous, but if you not only survive, but also *understand* it, you are at a great advantage compared to the other unfortunate souls that survived the cataclysm.

I can produce more examples if needed, but I imagine this is enough to get my point across. If a game has HP, it is a game where you can run out of HP, which means physical damage and death are going to feature to a greater degree, which means the world and its inhabitants are dangerous. If a game has travel rules, it takes place in a world where long distance travel is possible – that is a world much more hospitable than one where there is no need for travel rules because why have travel rules when you instantly perish if you leave the protective vicinity of \[insert McGuffin or place that makes living possible where it otherwise is not\]. For example, if the world was a watery realm with no surface, a water dimension if you like, and you are surviving in the one place your species can breathe and survive in, it’s more likely you’ll be doing faction play or dramatic character driven soap opera play or an otherwise urban sandbox than Tolkien-esque journeys, and that says a lot about the setting. *Unless* your characters can survive underwater and are accustomed to swimming around instead of walking. Which *again* says a lot about the setting and world.

Of course all of this applies less so to generic systems like GURPS, Genesys, Savage Worlds or BRP. However, even those kinds of systems will have genres they are more fitting to. I am not overly familiar with them, but from what I know, Savage Worlds categorises enemies into A. fodder and B. more important, “boss fight” kind of enemies. There are terms for them in the game but I do not recall them, so for now let’s call them “mooks” and “bosses”.

Separating foes in those two categories does two things

1. It relates a certain kind of genre: pulpy, superhuman/superhero, a hardboiled gumshoe noir perhaps, and certainly the kind of stories seen in Indiana Jones, Uncharted, Tomb Raider and related works that feature evil masterminds with means to have a small army of henchmen.
2. It supports the narrative of protagonists being able to fight their way through loads of foes and only really be challenged at “named”, important encounters, which treats people that might otherwise be of similar stat-lines in something more realism-focused, or lower power level, like GURPS or BRP, as actually being entirely different mechanically, even though realistically, they are all human.

And this is a nice segue into those more realism or low power focused games, that are good at exactly that: genres and stories where people are challenged by things a lot closer to what would challenge a person in real life. So if I was to run a game focused around a low fantasy, historically inspired sandbox, or a post- zombie apocalypse, GURPS or BRP would be better fits for it.

In summary, and just so I can put a bow on this thing cause I can go on forever otherwise, different systems are not *required* to achieve play in different genres or tones, but they *will* enforce those genres and tones if they are designed well for that, and that can oftentimes make a difference in the experience. You can of course play anything systemless – it’s not about what you can do, but about what sort of experience you want to have.

Socrates never wrote down his thoughts. His argument was that the written word is insufficient when trying to convey thinking and pose arguments, because it can’t react and adapt to talking points of the interlocutor. This post is inspired by what that might look like in a game where mages learn magic from books.

Magic is complex. It takes a long time to study, is as much science as is art, depending on your setting, and takes a toll on the caster, typically. At some point I might tackle the latter of the three, the second point can be somewhat addressed as fantasy alchemy (potions and such), and so this post is about what people in classic fantasy settings might do to tackle the former. A tutor is always more valuable than a book when it comes to learning, especially when learning something as complex and ephemeral as magic.

The problem is that the people who can teach you the magic you want to learn are powerful, selfish, often cruel mages; it is in their best interest to keep their power and secrets to themselves. In life, these magicians made pacts with dark entities from other worlds to sustain a mockery of their life force after death, turning them into a sentient skull that can speak telepathically, but cannot move. They may retain their memories and personality, but cannot act in the world of the living anymore without the help of someone living. “What about a *fly* spell, or undead servants” you ask? “Surely that’s simpler than having to entrust your magics to a stranger”. Sorry, prospective wizard, the forbidden pacts that grant you sentience after death necessitate your lack of independence. The transdimensional horrors you dealt with do not do this for charity – they want to be entertained and see you suffer. It’s also a nice killswitch someone clever can exploit, making it all the more fun for them. And before you start thinking up any loopholes, I’m afraid they won’t work. The magic of these beings is smarter than your legalese.

Skulls carried at the hip in a net or similar harness, dangling around like a bunch of giant grapes, looks cooler than a book. Which is surprisingly difficult to find images of. Art by warmtail

So why would this ever happen? Why not keep using spellbooks? Well, place yourself in the shoes of a powerful sorcerer with command over the elements of nature or space and time or the minds of people. What good does it do you to transpose your greatest power of unnatural forces that break the laws of reality into a book, in a world full of people who’ve taken it upon themselves to travel around in search of fools *just like you* and steal their valuable possessions for themselves because they can’t face the prospect of an honest day’s work in their lives? (oppressive lack of social mobility in medieval societies aside, fantastic or not) That’s like storing your passwords in a.txt file on your desktop and wondering why you can’t access anything after some time.

\[This is the point in the blog post where I’d segue beautifully into a Password Manager sponsor ad, if I had one. Instead I will continue with the topic and you’ll just have to imagine it to yourself and chuckle, once, probably.\]

This way, the magically talented movers and shakers of the region/country/world get to still be around to see their plots through after death – sharing power is arguably a small price to pay in return for that. That does not mean they make it easy, however. These villains are well aware how badly their keepers want their incantations and formulae. Their demands are as lofty as they were in life – and fertile adventure hooks for you. And with the voices of these haughty, maniacal and paranoid mages in one’s mind, it takes willpower of steel not to be driven mad and toss them in the ocean – which has happened more than once. The most diplomatic and resolute apprentices can even keep multiple dead mages sometimes, despite their constant bickering.

Imagine three of this guy just jabbering away inside your mind. Okay, he’s not quite the sword & sorcery vibe of this post, but you can see what I mean. If you’re not familiar with him, Planescape: Torment is a great game.

### The System

I originally backed Broken Compass, presumably like most people who own it, during its Kickstarter campaign, with all the bells and whistles – dice, GM screens, hardbound books, coins, badges, cards, and posters. It was my first big impulsive Kickstarter backing as far as I remember. So I was very excited when the big box came and I opened it up and took pictures and so on. I did nothing with it for the longest time – again, as I expect a lot of people do who just hit ‘Add to Cart’ on The Latest New Shiny. (I have thankfully overcome this behaviour. There’s nothing wrong with it if you can afford it, but my wallet couldn’t)

If you don’t know, Broken Compass is trying to emulate Pulp Action of the Indiana Jones/Lara Croft/Uncharted vein – people of action, grit and mettle with varying degrees of knowledge and respect of ancient cultures, swinging from ropes, shooting goons and raiding temples, presumably.

Recently I built up the interest and courage to try and run an RPG at work for whoever was interested. I knew I wanted something easy, fast, narrative, and lighthearted, and I knew I wanted to finally give Broken Compass a spin, so it didn’t take long to decide that was the game I was going to run. I sat down to learn the system and I did what I always do – read the book and take my own notes on the mechanics in a succinct and compact way. That way, I can reference my notes if I need to while running the game instead of the book, since rpg books can sometimes have subpar layout, formatting and indexing. This method proved especially necessary for Broken Compass since the book is written in a conversational, first person style, like a “narrator” is talking to the reader directly, the charm of which runs out as soon as one needs to use the book for what it is – a book of rules. This problem is not unique to Broken Compass. It is the reason I have not yet ran any of Kevin Crawford’s games. (he mercifully lacks the conversational, first person tone, apart from in Wolves of God. I mention his name mostly in relevance to subpar layout and walls of text) It is also the reason my notes on Vampire: The Masquerade V5 are so precious. Despite my note-taking on various systems at this point, it never gets easier to deal with.

Once I was able to discard the rambling writing of the book (the irony of my blog name is not lost on me) and had the bare-bones of the system laid out in front of me, I could not wait to get it to the table. Dice pool system? Sign me up. Using only D6? Yes please. Looking for similar die results to count successes? Erm…run that by me again?

You know, two-of-a-kind is a Basic success, three-of-a-kind is Critical, etc, all the way up to six-of-a-kind for tasks thought Impossible to achieve. Unique, check. Easy, check. Fun, check.

The Broken Compass character is described by a list of Fields (general aptitudes like Action, Knowledge, Society) and Skills (specific aptitudes like Drive, Shoot, Scout, First Aid) among other things. Each roll to achieve something risky is a dice pool of D6 of equal size to the total of a Field and Skill, usually the Field that the Skill being used falls under. (So, the Skills Fight, Leadership and Stunt all fall under the Action Field, meaning most of the time you are rolling those Skills, you’ll be pairing them up with the Action Field) Very similar to the Storyteller system of the World of Darkness games. Great so far!

Other parts of a character include a Luck score, which is the stand-in for Health, and the difference between narrowly scraping by a failed challenge and a Very Bad Situation, with the possibility of death, as well as a Luck Coin, which you use to achieve Extreme Successes automatically, ensure important items and vehicles survive destruction, avoiding Bad Feelings, which I will talk about below, and also avoiding said possibility of death. When you use a Luck Coin you flip it. What you use it for happens either way, but if it comes up Heads, you give it to the GM. Tails, you keep it and can use it again. You gain Luck Coins by doing impressive things, “good roleplay” and generally being awesome. An extremely vague yardstick for a very mechanical part of the game, but we all understand what they’re going for, and far be it from me to pretend like I don’t value trust in what the GM and the people at the table are doing over strict rules for every possible thing.

Bad Feelings, as I mentioned above and just as Good Feelings, are yet another part of a character, and they are Conditions by any other name, that give you Disadvantages and Advantages to your rolls respectively. Each Feeling pair is associated with a Field, and cancel each other out. So, if you feel Focused (Good Feeling) you have Advantage on Knowledge rolls, if you feel Dizzy you have Disadvantage, and if you have one and get the other, they cancel each other out so that you end up with neither. Simple, elegant, narrative. I like it. There is more to the system but as per the title of the post, this is only a review *of sorts*.

So far we are looking for similar dice results like in Liar’s Dice, and tossing coins. The gambling analogies are very thematic and usable at the same time. I hope you can start to see why I was excited to run this. Add to this a supplement for running the game in the 1920s and in the golden age of piracy and I’m hooked.

The only thing left then was to decide on the scenario. I wanted to run a published one from one of the many books I got from backing the game, to get a sense for how the developers imagined the system be used and what a session of the game looks like – and because I hadn’t run something like this before, and I could tell I would need help as someone used to running player-driven sandboxes. I picked the scenario called The Winning Code from the digital-only Luck Tales supplement. So let’s talk about that.

### The Adventure

In brief terms, in this scenario the players have to steal an artifact from a museum before its big reveal, and return it to their employer. The player’s Rival is in attendance at the artifact’s grand reveal. The players are told their Rival has a keen interest in the occult, which the artifact might be connected to.

Broken Compass makes a big deal out of always having a Rival in whatever scenario you choose to make and/or run. They are an intrinsic part of how the developers imagine and want this game to run. They provide a constant ticking clock to whatever the players do and an endless supply of goons for the players to heroically beat. “But what happens if they don’t beat them?” I hear you ask. “Shut up, the heroes beat the bad guys always” the game seems to say. But more on that later.

Once the players steal the artifact, the Rival sends their henchmen after them and a chase ensues which leads the players down the harbour, stealing boats and making their way to the meeting with their employer – taking place in a mausoleum – to hand over the prize. They can either shake off the Rival’s henchmen during the chase and have a Break (which mechanically replenishes their Luck Points), or if they fail to do so, have to race to the meeting with the henchmen hot on their heels. Either way, the game really wants there to be a showdown between the Rival and their private army, and the players. A bunch of people dressed like cultists show up mid-fight and help the players tackle the otherwise Impossible fight (with capital I, as in, the rolls to attack the goons are of Impossible difficulty, which is six-of-a-kind) thereby reducing it to just Extreme difficulty.

After the fight, the employer reveals themselves as one of the cultists. But don’t worry they reassure you they are the Good Guys and on your side, and take the Rival hostage. The cult then invites the players to use the artifact they stole to decipher some paintings and decorations in the interior of the tomb, which happens to be the resting place of the artifact’s maker, revealing a world-shattering truth once fully deciphered. This truth is supposed to be powerful enough to enable certain people on their path to world domination, one of which is the players’ Rival. The players then notice a hidden message that the artifact’s maker left behind, warning of the Truth falling into the wrong hands, and that if that came to pass, to “bury his work with him”. An additional successful check will reveal another hidden message to the players instructing them on how to trigger a hidden mechanism to cause a cave-in and bury the tomb and all its contents under, presumably, a lot of earth. The cult leader then makes a cult-y speech which makes it clear that the cult’s purpose is world domination after all. The Rival’s eyes light up and he makes the leader an offer to unite their assets and influence and rule the New World Order together. The leader accepts, and the Rival makes the same offer to the players. Either the players accept and presumably, the scenario ends with the players very wealthy and the world in danger of a tyrannical new ruler, or they refuse heroically and they activate the hidden mechanism to bury the cult, the Rival and the Truth forever. ( Of course, the players get out unscathed….somehow)

That is the long and short of the scenario. Some of the elements of the scenario are undefined and flexible, such as who the Rival is, what the artifact is, what the Truth is that is revealed, where the tomb is or who the cult are, etc, even where the adventure takes place and which museum you steal the artifact from. This is what all Broken Compass adventures do, and they provide a Context alongside each one. Each adventure’s Context provides details for all those elements of the adventure that are not defined, in case you want to skip the work of coming up with the details yourself. In the Winning Code’s Context, the Rival is a far fight politician, the artifact is an amphora, the museum is an Etruscan civilization specialist museum in Italy and the world-shattering Truth, the one secret meant to be powerful enough to signal a dark new age were it to fall into the wrong hands is…

the fact that the Italian people have a multicultural Etruscan heritage, dating back to the days of the Sea Peoples.

What? Is that it?

Indeed, the writers seem to think this Truth would reflect upon modern Italian people and would be powerful enough that it would undermine the “master race” narrative and propaganda of the Rival, the cult, or any other tyrannical world-ruling aspirant.

So let’s talk about all the problems I have with this assumption, and in fact with all assumptions the writers make in The Winning Code and sadly, as far as I can tell, every Broken Compass adventure.

Given modern day archaeology and understanding of history, is that really a revelation powerful enough that, were it to be revealed, would undo or even threaten a hypothetical modern fascist dictator’s power? Is it even a revelation at all, that the Etruscan people may have or definitely are descended from the Sea People? And even if that is true, is a civilisation that spanned the Mediterranean and was a mix of various heritages at all reflective of modern day Mediterraneans, given that said civilisation predates even Classical Greece and the territory in question has since seen innumerable influences from other cultures? I could make the argument, as could most people, that every modern culture, civilisation, nation and peoples are influenced by a very wide spread of other such cultures and civilisations, given the history we know. And it wouldn’t even be a brave or unusual statement to make. So I find it weird for the writers of this adventure to presume that such an assumption, let alone a fact, like that would be not only a powerful weapon against tyranny but a threat and deterrent so great that they would mobilise with the lack of consideration towards public image or open violence like the one they display in this adventure, sending mercenaries to shoot at civilians and chasing them down public, open streets with innocent bystanders all around.

Ok, I hear you, this is meant to be a pulpy action thriller and not realistic in every sense. Just realistic enough that we have the buy-in, right? And then we can introduce the occult, and comic-book villains, and cults and Big Secret Truths. Alright, fine. So let’s talk about the adventure in its own terms – that of a published module.

Read back on the summary of it with me and notice how many assumptions are being made. What if the players steal the artifact entirely under the radar, succeeding in every test of skill and stealth, like my players did when I ran it? That one is not as problematic, since you can feasibly skip the chase, though it does mean a much shorter adventure. But fair play if the players pull that off.

The players have to pass a skill test to learn that the artifact has a code – the code that helps them decipher the paintings in the tomb. If they fail that test, they won’t learn that.

The adventure states that “Whether the Adventurers were hired by members of the Secret Cult or they’re about to steal the Work of Art of their own volition is of little consequence.”

No it bloody isn’t. It is of very great consequence. If there is no employer, and specifically a cultist employer, the players have no reason to take the artifact to that specific meeting place and have all those revelations happen. If they just stole it for themselves, the adventure would end after (and IF) the players successfully escape the goons on boats chasing them after the heist. That would make for a much, much shorter adventure.

The next sentence in the adventure, after the quoted one above, reads “What really matters – as the sun plunges into the sea – is the time ticking by.” And that is really telling of what the writers focused on here. The adventure reads much more like a movie script than a role-playing game adventure written to keep things flexible for the table. I can’t believe I have to say this in a review of a professionally published adventure, but you *have* to make as little assumptions as possible when writing an adventure. Write situations and problems, not narratives and stories. The Winning Code is a story. The players steal an artifact from a museum, THEN they have a chase with the Big Bad, THEN they go to the meeting in the mausoleum, THEN the cult is revealed, THEN they use the code they uncovered to set off the trap to bury the bad guys in the tomb, THEN they escape as it collapses. Look at how many assumptions are being made.

During the chase, when the players reach the harbour, the text reads: “In this scene, the only means of transportation they \[the players\] find is an Unfit Boat. I trust you’ll come up with the worst.”

“After the shoot-out, the cronies are determined to give chase and retrieve the Work Of Art at all cost. They jump on two Very Fit Boats and so begins a frenzied chase with shoot-out on the water”

Where the fuck were the Very Fit Boats when the players were looking for means of escape? Why are we shoehorning a situation in the adventure that would fail the most basic, first playtest? Because, I imagine the writers would say, it raises the stakes to be in a shitty boat, while the bad guys chase you on fast ones. And there you have it again, what is being written is a movie script, not an adventure.

When the Rival makes the offer to the players to hand over the artifact, the text has you reading aloud this speech: “Ladies. Gentlemen. Let us be reasonable here. You can easily realize why the Truth would be most counterproductive to someone in my position. Please, hand over the Work Of Art and I can assure you that everything will continue just as before.”

At this point, the only way the characters can know that there is any big secret capital-T Truth relevant to the artifact is if they have succeeded on a test to eavesdrop on a conversation during the museum scene. If they didn’t, they have no context for this “truth” the Rival is speaking of. Which seems like a pretty awkward oversight.

Anyway, by this point, you get the idea. And I don’t hate the adventure. I had fun running it, but was pulling at my hair reading and preparing for it, and I had to make a fair amount of modifications and notes to have it make more sense and make things happen when the players unavoidably didn’t do what the adventure prescribed – or guessed at. I could do that because I have a certain amount of experience with improv and thinking on my feet when it comes to running rpgs. I am not sure how someone who is new to it would fare with this adventure – I imagine it would end up as linear as the text outlines, and with players feeling railroaded.

Perhaps I am being overly critical. I’d be interested to know your thoughts if you have ran this adventure. In my eyes, it is a good jumping off point for an adventure of your own, using the hook and maybe a couple of scenes from the text, but largely going off-script and just coming up with a more robust and flexible adventure yourselves. Which is a shame.

I recently went to the Lake District and hiked a ~10 mile section of the Ullswater Way and while my soft, weak body complained for most of it, I found it quite inspirational and undeniably beautiful. I wanted to just share with you some of the pictures I took and a small encounter table for forest, hills or grasslands overland hiking and travelling.

1. A partially rotted tree stump. Looks good for a short rest. Could house something insidious of an invertebrate nature.
2. A locally famous artist out on a walk. They’re secluding themselves for months in their second home nearby for inspiration. They look inebriated and lost.
3. A stream flowing under a short bridge. It might be safe to drink from. Something small glints as it is carried downstream.
4. A faded, mossy sign lies fallen over on the muddy ground. It reads ‘Sleeping Stones’. It looks like it was ripped out and hidden on purpose.
5. A dog wanders towards you on the trail. It sniffs you and you hear a voice in your head asking for treats. If you do nothing the dog leaves. If you give it treats, it thanks you telepathically and remarks that you are much nicer than the “scary, tall scarecrow man that passed by before you” and says that if you keep heading down this trail you will meet him.
6. A hilly, windbeaten rise with no trees and sparse undergrowth that gives you a majestic view of the land around you. Somewhere in the distance, you catch a glimpse of a creature the size of a skyscraper dissapearing as it walks behind a hill.

What I try to do here, I suppose, is break down elements of the stories we tell in RPGs into three loose categories, in terms of how we think about them: **Games**, **Puzzles**, and **Stories**, in descending order of “gamification”, or mechanical complexity if you prefer. There is no clear motivation for this: perhaps it will be useful or interesting to you, and I should certainly hope so. What it did for me is made me think about the RPGs I want to play and which of these categories they tend to fall into the most, and what that says about my tastes. But it also made me think about how to create a holistic element of an RPG story by trying to engage with all three categories during its creation.

These are not mutually exclusive and more often than not combine together in different styles of play.

## GAMES

Distinct and well-defined mechanics, with implicit or explicit game loops, or phases, and win and lose conditions per situation.

![](https://mdl.artvee.com/sftb/209194fg.jpg)

by Valentin de Boulogne

###### Characters

Anything that constitutes a character sheet that doesn’t look like scriptwriter’s notes. Attributes, Saves, Attack Bonuses, Special Abilities, Hit Points. Things that mean something to the system you are using, that can be impacted by the mechanics.

###### Locations

Locations don’t usually have stats, or character sheets, in RPGs, but there *are* some examples. [Blades in the Dark](https://www.evilhat.com/home/blades-in-the-dark/) and its derivatives give the player characters a base of operations with its own upgrades, stats, and so on. So does [Forbidden Lands](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/games/forbidden-lands/) and many more RPGs that want to focus on the players investing into a “base” as part of play, to give that extra dimension to the mechanics. But what if other locations had stats too? “Location sheets”, if you will. I am sure there are examples of games that do this, but I don’t know of any and it is a very interesting concept to me. Not just stats and abilities that affect the characters, like “Hostile Weather: 2” or “Mercantile Hub” but also stats that can be affected *by* characters (and possibly not just PCs but NPCs too). For example, a cliff with the tag “Steep” that a band of dwarves dig into to create a natural staircase on its face, giving it the “Stairs” or “Easily Scaleable” tag. Or if your game is less wordy and you like numbers, maybe its “Difficulty” stat is inititally 6 and after the dwarves’ work it becomes a 2. Or if you are math averse and don’t like formulas, perhaps instead of a host of stats that play into various mechanics and formulas, it just has a “Hearts” value, and by making a staircase, the dwarves got it down to 1 heart. And if they cleared the area of harpies too it would go down to 0, making it an effortless task. [ICRPG](https://hankerinferinale.wixsite.com/icrpg), inspired by the Zelda games (I believe) does that exact mechanic when it comes to chests, traps and other obstacles the players might face.

## PUZZLES

The caveat here is that the **Puzzle** in this context has multiple possible answers (if the game isn’t being railroaded too much). A situation that has certain parameters that stand out as important, that the players attempt to find a solution to either by their own wits and knowledge, using their characters equipment, or both.

The situation in question *has* to be problematic, otherwise the players have no motivation to find a solution to it, which would make it a **Story**, not a **Puzzle**. **Puzzles** have a start condition and one or more end conditions and they assume a character has the motivation to solve them, whether they’re a PC or a NPC.

There is a clear distinction here, and the whole reason why **Puzzles** sit between **Games** and **Stories** on the list. **Puzzles** are not **Games** because they do not need numbers, stats, or mechanics. They are solved narratively. But they are not **Stories** either. They have no *inherent* emotional importance and they still have problems and solutions, questions and answers, win and lose conditions. Of course they *can* be combined with **Games**, to add numerical and mechanical complexity, or with **Stories** to add emotional importance and impact.

###### Characters

As mentioned above, characters have to be viewed as situations that need to be solved somehow (i.e. problems), as well as having one or more possible solutions to be thought of as **Puzzles**. In that sense, characters have strengths and weaknesses, things that help them resist, confuse and stonewall whoever is trying to “solve” them.

The method of solving could be combat, verbal engagement, indirect or direct subterfuge, etc.

Combat is well understood, but an important note is that it doesn’t have to be lethal, it just means violence is employed.

Verbal engagement can be anything from charming and seduction to intimidation, to bartering, to compelling them. Each example of verbal engagement is further broken down to a specific approach.

Charming/seducting and intimidating puts the control in your hands while bartering and compelling shares control between yourself and the target. Different people will be more receptive to one of the two approaches more than the other, depending on what makes them “tick”, what they value, etc.

Charming and seduction is an attempt to directly tap into what they find intriguing, fascinating and/or attractive in a person, but those traits can be displayed either in conversation with them or, ironically enough, by body language and “show, don’t tell”, which is interesting because if you think of seduction and charming that way, you can think of it as something you can do at a distance, which can be handy when the target is someone you can’t easily reach, for example a noble sitting in a gallery seat in a theatre or a popular figure parading through a crowd behind [stanchions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stanchion) (we both learned a new word today; stanchions are those rope barriers they have in airports or art gallerie, museums, red carpet events etc. I totally had to google that word, I won’t even pretend otherwise).

Intimidation is a threat (or, if you want to be mafioso about it, a promise). That could be a threat of violence (to themselves or what and who they care about), of public humiliation (a.k.a blackmail), of a loss of wealth, power, societal stature, or anything else you can think of.

Bartering has to include both sides giving something up that is valuable to the other. If you are getting something valuable but not giving anything up, it is one of the other approaches.

Compelling can tap into the target’s ethics, desires (as long as that desire isn’t you, which would make it a seduction), values and is generally an attempt to make them think (if you are being deceitful), or realise (if you are being truthful), that what you are trying to convince them of doing is what they want to do anyway.

###### Locations

Any location that is dangerous relative to what the PCs are used to can very easily be thought of as a **Puzzle**. Tolkien’s Fellowship can scale the mountain, go through the mines of Moria, fly over the peaks with the help of the Eagles, or walk around the mountain range and avoid the danger altogether. The challenge is the weather, Sauron’s influence and meddling, The horrors that live in the mines, the treacherous terrain itself, both overground and underground, and the possible waste of time should all other dangers be avoided. The solution will depend on the wit of the characters (or players, if the story of The Lord of the Rings were a RPG playthrough), and what they can employ to solve the **Puzzle**. Scaling the mountain was a very attractive solution, before Sauron’s meddling put a stop to it. Flying over the mountain was not an option for many reasons I will not go into but which you can Google easily. And walking around the mountain range simply would take too long. So Moria it is.

### STORIES

**Stories** historically have been motivated by emotional payoff. If there is none of that involved, it is a history of events rather than a **Story**. RPGs being an entertainment medium, they are rarely about cataloguing a fictional series of events and how they turned out from a factual perspective (though [Kriegsspeil](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kriegsspiel) is exactly that, and was one of the inspirations for the entire hobby, which you can read a lot about if you Google it). The emotional payoff in question is twofold: payoff for the audience of the story (e.g. poetic irony, poetic justice etc.), and payoff for the characters (e.g. catharsis).

###### Characters

What drives someone to do what they do, what they hold dear and what they abhor, what fire burns in them or what void is in desperate need to be filled. Characters are also the combination of their upbringing and life events, and past choices combined with how their mind decides to interpret them. Emotion, of course, plays a heavy role in this equation. Thinking of characters as Stories in the context of this blog post necessitates that there are no mechanical considerations when it comes to the RPG being used, and that they are thought of as “real people”, with narrative traits that impact the emotional responses of other people they interact with as well as their own. If you need inspiration for how you can do this (other than reading about how to write effective characters in creative writing, outside of RPGs, like novels and short stories), look at [Hillfolk’s](https://pelgranepress.com/hillfolk/) character creation as well as Beliefs and Instincts from [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/).

###### Locations

Emotional impact on the characters in that location. The impact might be different if they are visiting, taking a prolonged stay, or used to spend a very long time in that location in the past. Nostalgia as well as trauma will colour the impression and emotions of the latter, and though the two are personal experiences, they can sometimes be shared through festivals, a communities’ shared toil to build and invest in something worth fighting for, or the collective horrors of war or famine. In the most fantastical of settings, the location may itself host emotions, reacting to characters with an agenda or simply raw emotion, giving it personality traits if not sentience.

### Afterword

In the interest of not making this post longer I limited the narrative element examples to Characters and Locations, but if you made it this far, well, for one I am flattered, but more importantly you may find it useful to think about other narrative elements like Objects of Legend, Historical Events, Factions, etc. and how they can all be thought of as Games, Puzzles and Stories.

Here’s a silly little game you can use to come up with ideas for games, zines, scenes in a session or really anything creative.

Take the format of the name “Dungeons & Dragons” where you take two words that start with the same letter, and do it alphabetically until you come up with an evocative prompt you like, then describe what it is about.

Some examples:

**Sonars & Stolichnaya:** You are USSR navy soldiers in the cold war, operating a U-boat. You are completely blasted on vodka to deal with the pressure/boredom of the job, when you start getting pings on your radar. You have to figure out if the pings are actually mines, or dolphins responding to you.

**Mustard Seeds & Melted Wax:** A game for two people – You are queer students in the 1920s that have a crush on each other. You communicate by writing letters to each other, but you have to mask the context and meaning of the letters using recipes as a code, so you aren’t found by your teachers/parents and banned from keeping in touch.

**Bees & Beetles:** Pick a side. It’s war.

You don’t have to only use two words, and they don’t have to rhyme, just as long as they sound good together to you. Some of them will sound like little more than the subject of a stand up comedy act, some of them will not work out, and some of them will actually be good ideas. Don’t worry about how it would work, or what the details are, you can work that out later; just try to come up with fun, evocative prompts that spark your creativity.

In one of his eminent YouTube videos about inspiration and process, the wise [Hankerin Ferinale of Runehammer](https://www.runehammer.online/) said that when you get a shiny new notebook, you should scribble all over the first page to get over the feeling of not wanting to mar the appearance of something brand new and perfect. (I couldn’t find the exact video or phrase; if you do, please link it). I suppose that’s what I am trying to do here.

I don’t think there’s a subject more relevant for this post than cognitive dissonance and biases. Specifically, about the struggle of trying to create something for public consumption.

For months I’ve been skulking around the RPG sphere; in Discord servers, blogs, YouTube videos and elsewhere, daydreaming of somehow contributing to the community one day with some nugget of wisdom, some amazing new mechanic or shortcut to fun gameplay that cuts through the slog of tiresome procedures. Imagine some bent over, disfigured, pale mutant stalking the group of high level adventurers around, building up the courage to pick up a spear and helmet and go do mighty deeds himself but never actually doing it. Ephialtes as portrayed in Zack Snyder’s 300 comes to mind, historical accuracy be damned.

And so I would almost immediately shut it down by thinking that it couldn’t possibly be original or innovative, that I couldn’t come up with anything worth talking or thinking about that wasn’t a rehash of other people’s ideas. That the space is busy as it is – it doesn’t need more noise.

This is nothing new to me. Whenever it comes to creating anything, in any space, it *has* to be fresh and intriguing. It *has* to be original. I stupidly try to ‘optimise’ that space by keeping clutter and duplicates to a minimum, and that is *exactly* what I see my contribution as. Everyone knows there’s nothing new under the sun, but I set a very high bar of originality for my own creations. And of course I never consciously carbon-copy anything, which is the reason I never finish anything creative I start anymore, if it is meant for the public’s eyes. But even the idea of creating something, putting it out there and someone seeing it and thinking “Oh, that’s funny, this is exactly like that other thing I saw the other day” makes me cringe (as much as I dislike the word, it is accurate) in discomfort.

If this sounds like you, keep reading.

There is a certain amount of cognitive dissonance that all humans are capable of. It is, as most things with humans, a mechanism of adaptability and survival. Maybe not survival in the technical sense in this case, but it helps us live with ourselves and our beliefs.

This is relevant because when I examine other people’s contributions to the RPG hobby, I never shoot them down for not being entirely or even highly original, creative or innovative. As someone who loves to bathe themselves with OSR content, I have been exposed and have enjoyed many people’s homebrewed hacks and rulesets that they have amalgamated from their favourite ideas of other people, who themselves did the same. Is that not the way of all creativity?

I am of course telling you things you already know, so let me cut to the chase.

![](https://greygnome.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/day41.png)

by Jason Glover

We subconsciously lump things we like together in groups, and in doing so fail to realise that if we break them down enough, none of them belong in a category with one another. They didn’t all succeed for the same reason; in whatever way you measure success. All they really achieved is that they spoke to people. They connected with an audience. Thinking in these terms helps me a great deal because it breaks down the illusion that there is a specific formula, format or approach to a creative undertaking that will resonate with others. There isn’t. All you can do is be honest. And saying it that way makes it sound small and a long shot, but honesty is a big deal. It puts yourself out there. And in the same way that no creative work is absolutely 100% original, no single person is entirely unique either. But every single person is unique *in some way*; in the weird, messy mish-mash of experiences, opinions, tastes, ideas and ideals. That means that anything you put out there will resonate with *some* people; the ones that share the individual things that make you who you are.

Your goal should not be for people to like your creations, but for your creations to be yours. Be weird. Be a disfigured pale mutant.

Now pick up that fucking spear.

To the people who helped me get this out the door and motivated me-you know who you are:

Thank you, sincerely.
