# Summary

- A monster's concept should be unique, compelling, and easily communicable.
- Monsters must be fun to fight, with appropriate, novel, and dynamic abilities, tactics, environment, and weaknesses.
- Design monsters to support interesting dungeoncrawling interactions beyond direct combat.
- Ensure monsters fit logically into the game world with clear, actionable connections.
- Monsters should pose diverse threats (beyond HP) and offer varied rewards (beyond XP).

# Key Rules / Features

- **Abilities:** Should be appropriate to fiction, novel, and dynamic to provoke player decisions.
- **Tactics:** Differentiate monsters through motivations, combat roles, goals, morale, movement, and attack modes.
- **Environment:** Integrate interactive elements like hazards, difficult terrain, cover, chokepoints, and verticality.
- **Weaknesses:** Prefer \"soft lock\" (e.g., double damage from silver) or \"versatile\" (e.g., food-motivated, scared of loud noises) weaknesses over \"hard lock\" ones.
- **Threats:** Attack various parts of the character sheet (HP, abilities, inventory, XP, skills) and out-of-combat resources (time, noise, reputation, treasure value).
- **Alternative Victory Conditions:** Design encounters where \"winning\" might involve preventing escape, protecting objects, gathering information, or specific non-lethal solutions.
- **Dungeoncrawling Interference:** Monsters can block paths, interfere with resources (rest, light, healing), create tunnels, communicate with the party, or apply dungeon-wide curses.

# Stat Block (if any)

{{ "If there is a stat-block or mechanical specification in the article (e.g. HP, AC, Damage, Speed, Resistances), extract it as a Markdown table; otherwise write **None / not applicable**." }}

Lub Glubs from Adventure Time (They look like drifting pool floaties until they get close.)
