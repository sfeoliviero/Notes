## Summary
"Gli inconsolabili" (The Unconsoled) by Kazuo Ishiguro is a surreal and introspective novel that follows Ryder, a renowned pianist who arrives in an unnamed European city to perform a concert. As Ryder navigates the labyrinthine city and its eccentric inhabitants, he grapples with memory, identity, and the elusive nature of time. The novel is a haunting exploration of art, responsibility, and the human psyche, blending dreamlike sequences with profound emotional depth.
