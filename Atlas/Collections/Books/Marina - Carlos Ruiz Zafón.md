# Marina

## Summary
*Marina* is a gothic mystery novel set in 1980s Barcelona that follows fifteen-year-old Oscar who meets the enigmatic Marina and her father. Together they uncover dark secrets involving a mysterious woman from the past and supernatural forces. Written before *The Shadow of the Wind*, this novel anticipates Zafón's signature themes: mysteries of the past, love for knowledge, and the gothic, timeless beauty of Barcelona.
