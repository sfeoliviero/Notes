# Memorie dal sottosuolo

## Summary
*Notes from Underground* is a groundbreaking psychological novella narrated by an unnamed, bitter, and isolated narrator who lives in the underground of St. Petersburg. The work is divided into two parts: philosophical reflections on human nature, free will, and the underground man's rejection of rational egoism, followed by reminiscences of humiliating episodes from his past. This influential work is considered a precursor to existentialist literature and explores themes of alienation, spite, and the complexity of human consciousness.
