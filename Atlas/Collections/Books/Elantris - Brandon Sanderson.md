# Elantris

## Summary
*Elantris* is a fantasy novel set in the city of Elantris, a once-glorious place where people with magical abilities, known as Elantrians, lived in splendor. However, a catastrophic event called the Reod transformed Elantris into a cursed city, and its inhabitants into immortal, powerless beings. The story follows Prince Raoden, who is secretly afflicted with the curse and sent to Elantris, where he must find a way to restore the city and its people. Meanwhile, Princess Sarene arrives in the neighboring kingdom of Arelon to marry Raoden, only to discover he is presumed dead. As political intrigue and magical mysteries unfold, Raoden and Sarene work to uncover the truth behind Elantris's fall and save the city from destruction.
