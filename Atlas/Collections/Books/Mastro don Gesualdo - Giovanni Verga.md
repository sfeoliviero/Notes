# Mastro don Gesualdo

## Summary
*Mastro don Gesualdo* is the second novel in Verga's planned cycle "I vinti" (The Defeated). It tells the story of Gesualdo Motta, a peasant who accumulates wealth and social status but remains trapped between two worlds - unable to return to his humble origins yet never fully accepted by the aristocracy. The novel explores themes of social mobility, the corrupting power of wealth, and the isolation that comes with success in 19th-century Sicily.
