plot: |-
  A long time ago, humanity stumbled upon magical creatures called Majik. To acquire the powers of a Majik, one has to pass a trial set by the being itself. While men are unable to use magic, a woman who has the ability to capture and tame Majiks is granted the title of a witch.

  Abandoned as a child in the middle of a mountain, Ichi learned to fend for himself by hunting. While he is a pacifist at heart, he would not hesitate to defend himself if he senses danger. Believing a sleeping creature in the woods poses an extreme threat to humanity, Ichi has prepared to kill it.

  Unbeknownst to Ichi, the creature is King Uroro, the King Majik who hates humankind. No witch—including the Abyssal Witch Desscaras—has been able to pass Uroro's test. However, Ichi miraculously acquires Uroro, thus becoming the first and only male witch. Armed with his newfound power and thirst to hunt down danger, Ichi is about to turn the lives of witches and Majiks alike upside down!
