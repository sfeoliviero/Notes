  When he was in third grade, Hayuma Minekoshi became entranced by the world of figure skating. After meeting a mysterious girl and witnessing her perform a mesmerizing triple axel at a competition, Hayuma resolved to learn the sport—even if he had to teach himself the basics. Despite the hardships, Hayuma persisted in hopes of encountering the enigmatic prodigy again. However, one year later, Hayuma discovered that the girl he admired disappeared from the limelight. Having never learned her name, he gave up hope of being able to find her again.

  Now in his third year of middle school, Hayuma moves from his small northern hometown to Tokyo, where he has a chance to learn figure skating properly. In a twist of fate, that same mysterious girl reappears at the rink. As the two reunite, former prodigy Kisara Saotome reveals that she had quit competing in singles to try her luck in pair skating. Seeing potential in Hayuma despite his lack of experience, Kisara invites him to be her temporary partner. However, Hayuma must face difficult training to catch up to Kisara's skill level—let alone be ready to compete.
