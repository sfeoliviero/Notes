## 🔍 Overall Assessment

**Status:** Solid foundation with significant gaps

**Verdict:** This is a well-designed core ruleset that needs expansion and clarification. The mechanics are sound, but the system is incomplete without character creation, magic rules, and equipment guidelines. With focused effort on the Priority 1 items, this could become a comprehensive, player-friendly RPG system.

**Confidence:** High (based on complete document review and cross-reference analysis)
