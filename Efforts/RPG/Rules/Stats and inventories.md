## Stats

There are four stats, that range from $2$ to $8$.
- **Might**: Represents physical strength and power.
- **Agility**: Represents speed, dexterity, and quickness.
- **Knowledge**: Represents intelligence, wisdom, and knowledge.
- **Willpower**: Represents mental strength, determination, and resilience.

## HP
A character starts with $1$d$6$. HP does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude. Damage that cannot be guarded against (from unseen sources, or hazards such as falls, fire, or gas) bypass HP. Resting for a few moments, catching one’s breath, and having a drink of water restores lost HP. 
### Inventories
There are two types of inventories: physical and mental. 

**Physical Inventory:**
Represents the amount of equipment you can carry and your stamina. A character has $\mathrm{max}(10,5+\mathrm{MGT})$ physical inventory slots in total.
- Items typically take up one slot.
- Small items can be bundled together.
- Bulky items take up two slots and are usually two-handed or awkward to carry.
Items in inventory can be either:
- Equipped (in active use)
- Stored (efficiently tucked away in a backpack or on the person)

**Mental Inventory:**
Represents the abilities and knowledge you possess, as well as your mental stamina. A character has $\mathrm{max}(10,5+\mathrm{KNOW})$ mental inventory slots.
- Abilities take one slot.
- Motifs takes one slot.
- Three languages takes one slot.
