## Martial path
_For each feat you take from this path, gain 1 HP_
- **Cleave**: When you kill a creature or roll max damage, you can make another attack.
- **Notches**: Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

	1. +1 Damage
	2. Expanded Critical Range (+1)
	3. Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon)
>For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

- **Die Hard:** Once per **Long Rest** when count a failure on a critical damage save as a success.
- **Favor of the Gods:** When you wear no armor, count $\left\lfloor  \frac{\mathrm{MGT}}{2}   \right\rfloor - 1$ as your AC. You gain +**1** HP per level.
- **Rage**: You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. While in a rage, you have favor on your attacks, all your melee attacks inflict +1 damage, and are immune to pain and fear. You might froth, or stare in battle-focus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

	While raging, you cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things. Spellcasting is not impossible, but all your spells must be damaging spells, which deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets). Mishaps and Dooms may be more severe. While raging, you cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. You can will yourself to stop raging with a 2-in-6 chance of success at the start of your turn as a free action. If one of your allies has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.
- **Danger Sense**: If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act on the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can make a test on **KNW** to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.
- **Feat of Strength**: Once per day, you have a 10 **MGT** for 1 round. Can also be used in combat.
- **Shrug it Off**: Once per combat, you may choose to regain 1d6+1 HP as a free action on your turn.
- **Extra Attack**: When you take the attack action, you may make a second attack as part of that action. (_This feat can be taken only if you have already one martial feat_)
- **Girded Loins:** Once per Short Rest, reduce damage from an attack by ½. You and any hirelings have favor on saves vs fear and on morale checks.
* **Deadeye:** When you miss with a ranged attack, your next shot is made with favor.
* **Crippling Shot:** If you hit with a ranged weapon, you can choose to deal 1 damage instead. The creature cannot move until the end of your next turn and their next attack deals ½ damage.
* **Impossible Shot:** Once per Long Rest, make an impossible ranged shot that automatically hits (e.g., around corners, parting a hair).
* **Quick Shot:** If you do not move on your turn, you may make an additional attack with the same ranged weapon (does not apply to weapons with long reload times).
* **War Cry**: Once per combat you may shout a loud war cry. Your party gains favor on their next test.
* **Firm Grip**: You can never be disarmed as long as you’re conscious.

## Magic path
_For each feat you take from this path you gain one Magic dice up to 4_. 
- **Wizard**: If you spend an hour studying a spell, you may add it to the list of those you know.
- **Spell Sight**: Magical objects and effects glow to your eyes when you are within 6m of them. You can tell how many MD a caster still has by making eye contact with them.
- Familiar: An intelligent spirit follows and serves you in the form of a natural creature with 1 HD. It can communicate with you telepathically, and you may cast spells from its location as if it were your own. If it dies, it returns d4 days later, understandably upset.
- **Magic Ward:** Reduce all incoming magic damage by ½. Once per Long Rest, negate the full effect of a spell that targets you.
- **Spell Eater (Reaction):** Once per Short Rest, when a spell is targeted at you, save vs WIL to absorb it and cast it once before your next Long Rest.
* **Sword Wizard:** You can cast spells while wielding a weapon. Replace spellbooks with rune-carved swords. Spells can be cast as part of a melee attack (roll +WIL).
* **The Thrice Divided Intellect:** You have ADV on saves to resist magical mind/sense attacks. Sleep & Charm spells do not affect you.
* **Elementary**: Learn two cantrips of your choice.
* **Enchantment**: You may invest a single MD and Spell into an object you touch over the course of ten minutes. Anyone wielding the object may activate the spell, using the MD. Casters may use the MD to power other spells. The MD returns to the object instead of you. You may recall the MD by touching the object.
* **Sorcery**: You may draw on your innate being to cast spells. Whenever you cast a spell, you may take d4 damage to add a single MD to the roll.
* **Sculpt Energy:** You can shape raw arcane force into destructive or useful forms. Casting a basic *Arcane Bolt* costs 1 MD. For each extra MD spent, you may enhance one property from the table below. Players describe how they sculpt their energy; the Warden determines the MD cost if unclear. As a rule of thumb, each MD adds a die of damage or one distinct magical effect. Some elements or effects may require specific knowledge or training, depending on the campaign.
	
>| **Spell Power** | **1 MD**    | **+1 MD**                  | **+2 MD** | **+3 MD** |
>| --------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
>| **Damage**      | 1d6         | 2d6                        | 3d6       | 4d6       |
>| **Range**       | Near        | Far                        | Distant   |           |
>| **Speed**       | Full turn   | Quick turn                 |           |           |
>| **Targets**     | 1           | 2                          | Blast     |           |
>| **Element**     | None        | 1 (Fire, Ice, Shock, etc.) |           |           |
>| **Damage Type** | Wound (STR) | Stun (DEX), Daze (WIL)     |           |           |
* **Minor Arcana:** You can shape subtle, non-lethal, or practical manifestations of magic. These effects never deal direct damage, are always quick turns, and have a maximum range of Near. They can restrain, disarm, confuse, move, or otherwise influence creatures and the environment. Casting a Minor Arcana spell costs 1 MD. Each additional MD enhances it as follows:

  * **Difficulty:** For each MD, lower the target’s Save ability by 2.
  * **Targets:** Each MD allows the spell to affect one additional foe Near the main target.
  * **Scope:** For non-combat effects, MD also determine the spell’s scale and impact:

    * **1 MD:** Small, personal effect (lighting a torch, closing a door, cleaning an item).
    * **2 MD:** Medium or interpersonal effect (camouflage, telepathy, a wall of wind).
    * **3 MD:** Large or extraordinary effect (animate objects, teleport a short distance).
    * **4 MD:** Mythic, reality-altering effect (true sunlight, mass levitation, bending time).

  The DM determines the appropriate Save (if any) and final MD cost based on the spell’s description and intent. Minor Arcana reward creativity and improvisation. The [Arcane Words of Power](https://blockdodgeparry.com/tools-tables#arcane-words-of-power) may inspire effects or act as thematic limits, depending on how magic works in your world.
## Scoundrel path
- **Practically naive**: You're perfectly at home away from "civilized" lands. So long as there are edible plants or animals in the area, you don't need a ration to have lunch (note that this is often not the case in "dungeons"). Further, you have favor to saves against natural phenomena (frostbite in the cold, exhaustion in the desert, malaria in a terrible campaign).
- **Lucky**: Once per day, you can re-roll one of your test.
- **Redirect**: When an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can force them to make another attack against another target within range. This attack is made with disfavor. 
- **Catfall**: You may treat falls as 6 meters shorter than they are. 
- **Swift**: Your move speed increases by 3 meters. Your movement in combat is now 2 zones in indoor spaces. 
- **Wallrunner**: When you move, you may treat non-slippery walls as flat surfaces. You may move up or down a wall in this way up to 3 meters. If you end your turn on a wall, you fall. 
- **Trapper**: You may spend 10 minutes in natural terrain or using available resources to manufacture a trap. Choose one reasonable effect for your trap, such as 1d8 damage, restrain, noise, etc. Creatures approaching the trap have a $\min(4,\#\text{feats})$-in-6 chance of triggering it.
- **Field Medicine**: When in a natural environment, you may spend an hour searching for natural remedies for one negative condition such as Injuries, Poison, or Disease. After the hour, make a **KNW** test to gain 1d4 treatments for that condition. Treatments are usable for 24 hours.
- **Slayer**: Once per combat, you may add $x$ additional damage to a hit, where $x$ is the highest HD of creature slain by your party.
- **Sneak Attack**: If you have favor on an Attack test, you deal an additional d6 damage on a hit. 
- **Signals**: You know the common “signals” of the underworld, and can convey a brief message to anyone else who knows those signals without others catching on.
- **Smuggler**: You gain 2 inventory slots hidden in your clothing. No one else can access these slots. You may retroactively shop during an adventure to fill these slots at any point.
- **Always Armed:** Even when disarmed, you still have a hidden dagger.
* **Erosion:** You have favor on AGI test to avoid traps and seen attacks. If success would halve damage, you take none instead. Fall damage is halved.
* **Great Escape:** Once per Long Rest, automatically escape from a plausible restraint (grapples, traps, social situations). 
* **Pack Rat:** You have 3 additional Item Slots.
* **Skulker:** You have favor on test to Move Silently and Unseen.
* **Wilderness Sense:** You have _Favor_ on **KNW** test to track, hunt, and navigate in wilderness areas. When guiding, terrain penalties are reduced by 1. When alone or with others who have this talent, you cannot be tracked and are immune to terrain penalties.
* **Cartilage System**: Your body is far looser than it appears; you can conceal yourself wherever a child could.
* **Incouspicous**: You are a master at blending into a crowd. You can hide in a group of people as you would behind an impermeable surface. When travelling with a party, assailants never attack you first.
- **Thief**: When you attempt to pick a lock or a pocket, fumbles become failures, failures become successes, and successes become criticals.
- **Concoctions**: You may spend an hour dissecting a creature to gain a number of Reagents equal to the creature's HD. You may brew a potion over the course of 10 minutes from one of those reagents. Drinking the potion grants you a single feature from that creature for 10 minutes, inflicts 2d6 damage (poison), or grants d6+Drinker's Level in healing. Decide when you create the potion.
- **Con Artist**: You can lie with ease out loud and on paper. This allows you to draft legal documents that will appear legitimate at a cursory inspection.
- **Disguise**: You can disguise yourself and other party members quickly and effectively given feasible time and resources. You can’t make royal robes out of a handful of straw, but you can become somebody else with well-applied face paint and new clothes.
- **Entertainer**: You have _favor_ on rolls to entertain others, make merry or stall. You can engage targets in long-drawn out conversations about a topic they know a lot about and/or are passionate about for 1d4 hours, after which they will realize you are a poseur and react angrily to you. Unless, of course, you really do know/are passionate about that, in which case you can keep their attention for 1d4 days, with breaks to eat, drink and sleep. Will distract from urgent issues, but not immediate threats, e.g. the royal ambassador is demanding an audience, not a group of bandits just jumped through the window. 
- **Recitation**: You can quickly memorize and accurately recite long texts; letters, dispatches, essays etc. Afterwards, you may copy down the text again. This extends to magic texts and spellbooks, though you don’t understand what they mean, and thoughtlessly repeating magic words is its own punishment.
- **Flourish:** Whenever you fail an attack test, a AGI test, or a WIL test in combat, you may make a distracting and flamboyant Flourish to succeed anyway. If you do, your enemies get favor when attacking you until the start of your next turn. Your Flourish also draws attention to you, and enemies will prioritize you over your allies if you're within range of their attacks.You can always choose to Flourish as an action on your turn if you want to draw attention on purpose. You may Flourish multiple times in a round, but the AC penalty from Flourishing stacks.
- **Swashbuckle:** Once per turn, on your turn, you may make a Charisma test. On a success, take an additional gambit that turn. 
- **Improvised Explosives**: With ten minutes of prepwork and 3 inventory slots of adventuring gear, you create a bomb with properties similar to the items used. Items spent are consumed. The bomb takes up 1 inventory slot and deals 2d6 damage in a 10' radius; double damage to inanimate objects and terrain. It can be detonated manually (not recommended), and automatically detonates when damaged.

	Some item effects:
	- Rope: Create a fuse up to one hour in duration, or a tripwire.
	- Alcohol or oil: Fire damage; leaves burning puddle.
	- Projectiles (arrows, bolts, ball bearings, etc): Shrapnel. +5' radius for each slot.
	- Black powder: +1d6 damage.
	- Magnesium: Bright flash. Everyone in radius must save vs. blindness.
	- Magic item: Discuss with your GM.
- **Animal Companion**: You have a faithful pet: 2d6 for stats, 3 HP, d6 attack.
- **Companion**: You have an assistant, bodyguard, or errand boy. Roll 2d4 for stats, 3 HP.
- **Provocateur**: Whether through boasting or appealing to a sense of honor, you know how to goad someone into a duel. You can force those who understand you to make a WIL Save. If they fail, they’ll be compelled to duel you.
- **Singer**:	You know how to sing stimulating songs, inspiring those around you.
- **Devotion**: You gain +1 Faith Die, up to a total of 4.
- **Heightened Senses**:	You get a “weird feeling” when there’s a secret passage close to you.
- **Dungeon Architect:** With five minutes (or, three times in a short rest) and your toolbox, you can:

	1. make a trap or other mechanism trigger when a specific condition is met, or at a chosen time.

	2. secure doors so they can't be opened without breaking them down, as a Lock spell.

	3. hide features of constructed environments (like a door or arrow slot in a wall, or grease or a rune on a floor).

	4. break down or erect 10' of mundane walls, or excavate an equivalent amount of material (roughly a 5' cube).
- **Diagrammer:** After seeing the outside of a location, you can roughly sketch its inner plan. From inside a room, you can roughly sketch adjoining rooms that you know about.
- **Stonespeaker:** You can deduce the goings-on in a room by analyzing the layout and the scuffs on the floors, walls, and furniture. In a room, you may ask a question of the space like a Speak With Dead spell. Do this only once per room.
- **Living off the Land**: In the wilderness, by spending 1 hour you may find: a shelter from the elements, a source of drinkable water, a single ration, the way to the nearest settlement or some useful stones/sticks that you can use to make simple tools (you may also use the stones as ammunition for your shotgun, or the sticks to start a fire). Your GM may decide that it is harder to find some of these in extreme conditions, in which case they may double(eg. food in winter or shelter in plains) or quadruple (eg. water in desert, food in Veins of the Earth). You know the weather a day in advance through a mix of aching in your bones and knowledge of the winds.
- **Camouflage Mastery**: You learn how to perfectly meld yourself and others into their environments. By spending a turn covering yourself in local muck and shrubbery/junk (works both indoors and outdoors) you can make yourself or a different person functionally invisible, as long as you're not moving. You can do the same to your traps.
- **Inventive Engineering**: You carry a collection of strange and versatile components—bits of wire, shards of glass, vials of fluids, scraps of metal, sinew, salt, and other unsettling materials. Each Component takes up one inventory slot. They can be replenished in any town for 10gp, or, if conditions allow, scrounged in the field (ask your DM).
	You can combine these materials to create Emergency Inventions—temporary devices that solve a single problem. Crafting one consumes two Components, and the invention lasts 1 hour per Inventor template. The device can mimic any existing mundane tool or item.
	Examples include:
	- A lantern of bone and phosphorescent rot (lasts 3 hours, as a flask of oil)
	- A dagger made from sharpened scrap metal
	- Acid to dissolve a lock
	- A hand-crank winch of hair and broken sword handles
	- 50’ of rope made from stitched intestines
	*Your inventions are crude, unstable, and short-lived—but they work just long enough to matter.*
	- **Masterwork Inventions**: Masterwork Inventions are unique. Your Inventor created them and only they can use them. If damage or destroyed, the invention can be rebuilt with 10 Components and at least one ingredient the DM decides upon, and 24 hrs of work (spread over several days if necessary).
	_Sample Masterwork Inventions_
	1. **Essence Transfusion Syringe**. Two large syringes connected by an octarine cord. This device has the incredible power of transferring physical properties between two separate objects given 2 components and a minute of work. Choose or roll on the table below for each Inventor template to determine which properties you are able to transfer.
		1. Shape
		2. Size
		3. State (liquid/gas/solid)
		4. Weight
		5. Color & Opacity
		6. Smell and Taste
		7. Softness/Hardness
		8. Toxicity
		If you transfuse the softness between a plate of armor and a satin shirt, the satin shirt becomes as hard and inflexible as the armor, while the plate becomes as loose as flexible as cloth. A lantern made liquid may become a gooey mess that can be kept perpetually burning by feeding it oil.
		Either target cannot be any larger than a horse.
		Animate creatures must Save or die.
		Magical targets may prove more difficult to alter.

	2. Hydian Potion
		A foul potion emanating toxic fumes, poison to everyone but its creator’s anatomy.
		After the Inventor merely inhales the fumes, all sin and mental strength is expelled from them and projected into an evil caricature of themselves, whilst they themselves become meek and virtuous.
		Both versions are controlled by the player as separate entities. 
		Each turn the evil clone commits feats of good, virtue or meekness, both clones take 3 damage, vice versa for the good clone.
		All damage and effects taken are shared between the clones.
		The two clones can be merged with the consent of both clones, allowing the original Inventor to return.
		If either clone dies, the other lives on but cannot use the Hydian Potion or return to their original state.
- **Overclocking**: As an action you can overclock a mechanical, organic or magical object by spending two Components, roughly doubling its capabilities for d6 rounds, after which it falls to pieces, GM determines effects, but the table may make suggestions.
	If the item is useless after use inherently, there’s instead a 33% chance it is destroyed immediately before being overclocked.
