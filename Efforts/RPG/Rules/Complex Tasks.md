# Complex Tasks & Actions

Some tasks and actions undertaken by players take place over a longer span of time and involve multiple stages or phases.

**Examples:**
- Finding information on how to tame griffons in the Halls of Knowledge in the Great City of Grine.
- Tracking down the legendary swordsman Gervais in the seedy underbelly of Sulos, City of Thieves.
- Hunting down Grilof the Grim, a fierce gray wolf, in the Emberwoods.
- Locating Leopold Blackwater, bandit leader, in the Salt Flats.
- Socializing into the Court of Smiles, a members-only club.
- Finding healing herbs in the Golden Steppes to cure severe burns.

Any dedicated action done over a stretch of time (not just in a single moment) can be a complex task: analyzing, studying, training, patrolling, researching, tracking, deciphering, fortifying, etc.
