# Before The Fight Starts

---

## Surprise

When one or both sides in a conflict fail to notice the other, roll **1d6** to determine surprise:

| Roll | Result                     |
|------|----------------------------|
| 1    | Party is surprised         |
| 6    | NPCs are surprised          |

The surprising side gets a free round of actions/attacks before initiative is rolled. In some cases (e.g., ambush), surprised combatants cannot use their **HP (Hit Protection)**.

**Situational Modifiers:**

| Situation                          | Surprise Roll Adjustment |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Low visibility (e.g., sandstorm)   | 1-2 (party), 5-6 (NPCs) |
| Natural element advantage           | 1-2 (party), 6 (NPCs)   |
| No chance of surprise              | 1-3 (party), none (NPCs)|

---

## Reaction

When the party encounters NPCs with unclear reactions, roll **2d6**:

| 2d6 Roll | Result   |
|----------|----------|
| 2        | Hostile   |
| 3-5      | Wary      |
| 6-8      | Curious   |
| 9-11     | Kind      |
| 12       | Helpful   |

**Context Matters:**
- Unarmed/unarmored PCs may be seen as unassuming.
- Heavily armed/armored PCs may appear aggressive.
- **Weapons drawn:** Subtract **1d4** from the reaction roll.
- **Weapons sheathed:** Add **1d4** to the roll.

# Time & Place: Rounds, Ranges & Zones

---

## Rounds

- A **round** is roughly **10 seconds** of in-game time.
- Used to track timing in combat or time-sensitive situations.

---

## Ranges

| Range     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Close     | Within punch or sword range.                                               |
| Near      | In the same room; reachable within a few moments.                          |
| Far       | A few rooms away; optimal for ranged weapons.                             |
| Distant   | Barely visible; beyond the range of ranged weapons.                        |

---

## Zones

- The DM divides the battlefield into **zones** based on context.
- Consider:
  - Maximum occupants (chokepoints).
  - Environmental factors (cover, hazards).
  - Environmental dangers (heat, water, smoke).
- **Movement:**
  - Move to an adjacent zone as a standard action.
  - Use a full turn to move an additional zone.
  - Moving out of a zone with enemies may provoke a quick attack (**1d4 damage**).

---

# Initiative: Who Goes First?

---

At the start of each initiative turn, one errant is called upon to select either odd or even. That player and the DM will each roll a d6, add them together, and see whether the result is odd or even. If the player called odd or even correctly, the company may act first, otherwise the other side acts first.

An initiative turn proceeds in the following order:
Determining Initiative Turn Order
1. Characters on the winning side act quickly.
2. Characters on the losing side act quickly.
3. Characters on the winning side act slowly.
4. Characters on the losing side act slowly.
Any ongoing effects expire at the end of an initiative turn.

## Quick Turns & Full Turns

| Turn Type  | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quick Turn | Single action (attack, move, cast a fast spell).                          |
| Full Turn  | Move + action, or actions that take more time (e.g., moving and attacking).|

**Quick turns resolve before full turns.**

# Attacking

1. **Make a Test:** The attacker makes a [Test](Rules#Tests) on the relevant attribute.
2. **Determine Outcome:**

| Tier | Result                                                    |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The attack fails.                                         |
| 2    | Subtract the target's **Armor** from the weapon's damage. |
| 3    | The target receives **full damage**.                      |
   
3. **Damage Application:**
   - If **HP** is reduced to **0**, leftover damage is dealt to **MGT**.
   - If **MGT** is damaged, a **Critical Damage Save** is triggered.
3. **Narration:**
   - Attacks that damage **HP** but not **MGT** can be narrated as non-lethal effects (e.g., "shaken," "dazed").

---

## Weapons
## Dual Weapons
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, add 1d4 to the damage of one of the two weapons. If both weapons have different lengths for the purposes of initiative, one of which would allow the user to go before the target and one of which would usually require a **AGI** Test (or go after the target altogether), the user can choose to either strike only with the quicker weapon or wait and strike with both.

---

## Detachments

- Large groups or powerful foes act as a **detachment**.
- **Attacks against detachments:** Receive -1d4 to the damage.
- **Attacks by detachments:** +1d4 to the attack and have the **Blast** property.
- **Critical Damage Save:** Detachments roll **WIL**; failure means routed, **0 WIL** means destroyed.

---

## Stunts & Maneuvers: Gambits

- **Gambits** (e.g., stunning, shoving, disarming) deal **no damage**.
- Perform a test. 

| Tier | Result                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | The Gambit fails                                             |
| 2    | The target has to take an opposite test to avoid the gambit. |
| 3    | The Gambit succeds                                           |

# Defending

## Armor

- Subtract **Armor** from damage rolls before applying to **HP**.
- **Shields** provide a bonus (+1 Armor), but only while held/worn.
- **Maximum Armor:** 3 (light: 1, medium: 2, heavy: 3).

---

## Sacrificing Gear

- Sacrifice equipment to negate an incoming blow.
- **Requirements:** At **0 HP** or voluntarily drop to **0 HP**.
- **Effect:** Equipment is destroyed; repair costs **75%** of the item’s original cost (shields cannot be repaired).

## Block, Dodge & Parry

| Defense Type | Effect                                                                                     | Fatigue Cost                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Defend       | Default; take damage to **HP**.                                                            | None                             |
| Fight Back   | Attack after taking damage; **1 Fatigue**.                                                 | 1 Fatigue                        |
| Block        | Impair **Fast (d6)** or **Balanced (d8)** attacks; requires balanced/slow weapon or shield. | 1 Fatigue (unless shield/slow + heavy armor) |
| Dodge        | Impair **Slow (d10)** or **Balanced (d8)** attacks; cannot dodge in heavy armor.            | 1 Fatigue (unless fast/unarmed + light/no armor) |
| Parry        | Roll weapon damage; compare to attacker’s roll.                                           | None                             |
