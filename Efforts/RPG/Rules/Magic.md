# **Magic**

Magic in the world flows from three great sources: **Arcane**, **Divine**, and **Lyrical**.

- **Arcane Magic** draws on knowledge, willpower, and risk. It bends reality through understanding and manipulation of unseen forces.
- **Divine Magic** flows through faith, devotion, and surrender. It manifests as miracles granted by higher beings or sacred ideals.
- **Lyrical Magic** channels emotion and story through melody. Songs that echo with real power.

The three differ in philosophy and method, yet all are expressions of the same universal mystery.

> **Flavor is flexible.**  
> Magic can appear in any form:
> 
> - Arcane fire might be divine light or druidic spores.
> - Healing prayer could manifest as a wizard's enchantment.
> - Rituals might be songs, blessings, or strange bargains.

Ultimately, **the form is flavor**—the **mechanics remain the same.**

# **Universal Magic Rules**

## **Spellcasting Requirements**

To cast a spell, you must be able to **speak** and either have **one free hand** or wield a magical **implement** (wand or staff).  
You cannot cast in the same round you wield a **two-handed weapon.**

## **Concentration**

Casting magic requires focus. When distracted or attempting to cast silently or subtly, your spell may **fizzle**.

You are considered **distracted** when:

- Taking damage from an attack of opportunity
- Casting from a spellbook as a full-round action (unless immune to pain)
- Drugged, drunk, sick, in agony, or on fire
- Swimming, grappling, or falling

When distracted, make a **WIL Test**:

- **Success:** The spell is cast as intended
- **Failure:** The spell fizzles. Roll Magic Dice (MD) as usual—some may still be spent, and you might suffer **Arcane Feedback**

# **Arcane Magic**

Arcane magic is the manipulation of the world's invisible structure through intellect, training, and will. It is dangerous and unpredictable—immense power always carries risk.

## **Magic Dice and Cantrips**

Arcane casting uses **Magic Dice (MD, d6)**, gained from:
- **Skills** (e.g., _Gifted_)
- **Equipment** (such as enchanted items)

Magic Dice are **not consumed** but reflect your **capacity** for channeling power. You may roll them repeatedly throughout the day—though each casting risks fatigue or worse.

Minor spells, or **cantrips**, are innate to the caster. They can be performed freely, without words or gestures, but cannot be learned or exchanged.

## **Casting Process**

### 1. Invest Magic Dice
Choose how many MD to invest, up to your available maximum. The effects depend on:
- **[dice]** — the number of dice rolled
- **[sum]** — their total
- sometimes the **highest roll**

**Armor Penalty:**
- Light/shield: –1
- Medium: –2
- Heavy: –3

Apply this penalty to your total [sum]. If the total becomes **0**, the spell **fizzles.**

### 2. Roll the Dice
- For each **4–6**, gain **1 Fatigue**
- For each **6**, you may choose to roll **one additional MD**, even above your limit (max 4 MD total)

### 3. Resolve the Spell
The spell's effects take place as described. Effects scale with the dice invested and the power of the result.

### 4. Arcane Feedback
After resolving the spell, check for **duplicates** among your rolls. Each matching number represents unstable resonance. Add those dice together — the total is **Feedback Damage**, dealt first to **HP**, then **WIL**.

- Example: Rolling 4-3-3 causes 6 Feedback Damage
- If Feedback Damage >6, the effect has **Blast**, harming everyone **Close**

Even when Feedback occurs, the spell still takes effect.
### 5. Counterspell
Since the use of magic must be declared at the start of a combat round, there are opportunities to intervene in the casting. Anyone with Magic Dice at their disposal can, at the moment an enemy spell is cast, attempt a **counterspell**. This option is not available if the caster is already focusing on a spell themselves.A counterspell simply means **investing** and **rolling** an available number of MD, following the same rules for casting (i.e., Fatigue on a 4+ and Arcane Feedback occurs on doubles). If the total roll is **equal to or higher than** the total roll of the enemy spell, the two cancel each other out in a bright display of energy and light. If the roll is lower than the enemy spell, the counterspell fails and the enemy spell takes effect as normal.

## **Casting Arcane Spells**

1. ### **Invest Magic Dice**
    
    Choose how many MD to invest, up to your available maximum.  
    The effects depend on:
    
    - **[dice]** — the number of dice rolled,
        
    - **[sum]** — their total, and
        
    - sometimes the **highest roll**.
        
    
    **Armor Penalty:**
    
    - Light/shield: –1
        
    - Medium: –2
        
    - Heavy: –3
        
    
    Apply this penalty to your total [sum].  
    If the total becomes **0**, the spell **fizzles.**

3. ### **Resolve the Spell**
    
    The spell’s effects take place as described.  
    Effects scale with the dice invested and the power of the result.

4. ### **Arcane Feedback**
    
    After resolving the spell, check for **duplicates** among your rolls.

## **Types of Arcane Casting**

Arcane spellcasters typically channel power in one of four ways:

- **Sculpt Energy:** Direct attacks, elemental blasts, and destructive forces
- **Tricks:** Manipulative effects that hinder, restrain, or confuse foes
- **Counterspell:** Deflection or nullification of other magic
- **Practical Magic:** Environmental manipulation, illusions, or enchantments

This division helps define the **intent** of the spell rather than its appearance.

## **Power and Risk**

Arcane damage is unique—it ignores the normal rule of using only the highest die. A wizard rolling 4 MD may deal **4d6 damage**, reflecting pure, uncontrolled power.

This imbalance is intentional. Arcane casters are walking weapons—but fragile ones.

### **Feedback Risk by Magic Dice**
|**MD Rolled**|**Chance of Feedback**|**Nature of Risk**|
|---|---|---|
|2 MD|16%|Minor backlash likely|
|3 MD|44%|Dangerous|
|4 MD|72%|Catastrophic|

### **Fatigue Risk (High-MD casting)**
- 93% chance of at least 1 Fatigue
- 68% chance of 2 Fatigue
- 31% chance of 3 Fatigue
- 6% chance of 4 Fatigue

Each MD requires an **empty inventory slot**—a subtle cost that limits how much you can carry.

---

## **Magical Limits and Regulation**

The system defines no hard ceiling for magic, encouraging creative problem-solving. However, world-breaking spells (_Wish_, permanent enchantments, alchemy) should always create **new challenges**, not shortcuts.

### **Warden Tools for Extreme Magic**

1. **"Yes, but…"** — The act is possible but demands rituals, rare materials, and time. Adventures can arise from gathering what's needed.

2. **"Be careful what you wish for."** — Great acts of magic have consequences—divine wrath, social upheaval, or worse.

3. **Laws of Magic.** — Some things simply cannot be done. Magic is vast but not limitless.

4. **Arcane Words of Power.** — Only forces named in the Words can be shaped. Anything beyond them is unreachable.

### **Power Regulation Options**
To further regulate power, the Warden may:
- Cap available MD (e.g., no spell beyond 1 MD)
- Exhaust MD that roll 4–6, restoring them only after rest

---

## **Arcane Equipment**

### **Magical Implements**
|**Item**|**Bonus**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|
|**Trinket** (ring, amulet, charm)|+1 MD|Bonuses do not stack|
|**Wand**|+1 MD|Power 1–3|
|**Staff**|+2 MD|Power 4–6, usable as weapon|

**Power** represents how much magical strain an implement can absorb before cracking. When its Power reaches 0, the implement grants no MD until repaired (1 Power restored per day of attention and materials).

**Example:**  
Harvald wears an Inscribed Emerald Ring (+1 MD) and wields a Gnarled Oaken Staff (+2 MD, Power 3). He rolls 3, 5, and 5. He can spend **2 Power** to negate the duplicate 5s and avoid 10 Feedback damage, or later use **3 Power** to nullify an enemy's 3-MD spell entirely.

## **Advancing Arcane Power**

Each of the following can permanently grant **+1 MD** (once per type):

### **Material Gains**
- Wear exquisite robes (100+ gp) and no armor
- Steal a legendary staff or wand
- Control a tower, dungeon, or demesne

### **Supernatural Bargains**
- Consume or wed a magical being
- Accept possession by a demon
- Forge a pact with devils or fae
- Found a cult that empowers you through sacrifice

### **Self-Transformation**
- Learn your **True Name**
- Devour god-flesh
- Bind another wizard's soul
- Replace your blood or organs with magical substances
- Engrave runes across your body
- Implant enchanted bones or relics

### **Transcendent Experiences**
- Drink from a ley line or pure elemental source
- Transcend through otherworldly experience or visions
- Master the cycle of life and death

# **Divine Magic**

Divine magic is not seized through will, but granted through faith. It is the voice of gods, spirits, or eternal ideals channeled through mortal vessels. Unlike arcane magic, it is shaped by obedience, devotion, and belief.

## **Higher Powers and Faith**

To perform **Miracles**, a devotee must swear service to a **Higher Power**, which has:

- **Domains:** Aspects they govern (life, death, fire, sea, joy, etc.)
- **Enemies of Faith:** Opposed beings or forces (undead, heretics, demons, criminals, etc.)
- **Worship:** Required prayers, offerings, or acts
- **Temperament:** Their nature—jealous, benevolent, distant, or inscrutable

Discuss these details with the Warden to ensure the Power fits the world.

## **Prayer Books and Sacred Focus**

Miracles are recorded in a **Prayer Book** (1 inventory slot). Losing it prevents you from altering which miracles are memorized.

Casting requires a **Focus**—a sacred item such as a pendant, ring, or tattoo. Many deities demand their symbol be displayed openly; concealing it risks disfavor.

Each **imprinted Miracle** occupies **1 inventory slot** as mental and spiritual burden. You may rearrange your imprinted Miracles:

- **At sunrise**, freely
- **During the day**, with 10 minutes and a **WIL Save** (failure prevents further changes until the next dawn)

Miracles may be forgotten by wounds or Fatigue but not willingly dropped.

## **Miracle Casting Process**

1. **Declare the Miracle** — Casting takes a **full turn**, during which you cannot defend

2. **Invest Faith Dice (FD, d6)** — You may invest up to **4 FD**

3. **Roll FD and Take Damage:**
   - On 1–3: take **1 WIL damage**
   - On 4–6: take **2 WIL damage**
   
   This damage does **not** trigger Critical Saves.

In miracle descriptions:
- **[dice]** = number of dice rolled
- **[sum]** = total of all rolls

---

## **Example Miracles**

### **Supportive Miracles**
**Bless** — Create a **Pool** equal to [sum]. Allies may draw points from it before rolling Saves to temporarily increase an Ability score. Pool lasts until sunset.

**Empower** — Grant [sum] allies divine vigor. For one battle, they deal +[dice] **Bonus Damage**.

**Divine Protection** — Select [dice] targets. They gain **3 Armor** for their next [dice] attacks suffered.

### **Healing and Restoration**
**Replenish** — Heal [dice] allies for [sum] HP each, up to their maximum HP.

**Surge of Resilience** — For [dice]×10 minutes, one target gains [sum] to a damaged Ability (not exceeding its max).

### **Offensive Miracles**
**Rebuke** — Affect [sum] **Enemies of Faith**. Each must roll WIL ≤ their score but > [dice], or flee in terror.

**Smite** — Infuse your weapon with holiness. For your next [dice] attacks, deal +[sum] **Bonus Damage**.

### **Utility Miracles**
**Purify** — Cleanse food or water.
- 1 FD: one meal or waterskin
- 2 FD: up to four portions
- 3 FD: neutralize nearby toxins or gases
- 4 FD: long-lasting purification

**Elemental Protection** — Ward up to [dice] targets from extreme weather for [sum] hours.

## **Daily Prayer and Recovery**

At day's end, the devotee offers a **short prayer**. The Warden judges how faithfully you served your Power and grants a **piety bonus** (+0 to +3).

Then roll **1d6 + bonus**:

|Roll|Result|
|---|---|
|1|The Power is displeased. **Recover no WIL.**|
|2–3|Silence. Regain **1d2 WIL.**|
|4–5|Approval. Regain **1d4+1 WIL.**|
|6–8|Blessing. **Recover all WIL.**|
|9+|Exaltation. **Recover all WIL** and gain +1 free FD (max 4) for tomorrow's Miracles.|

---

## **Daily Prayer**

At day’s end, the devotee offers a **short prayer**.  
The Warden judges how faithfully you served your Power and grants a **piety bonus** (+0 to +3).

Then roll **1d6 + bonus**:

|6–8|Blessing. **Recover all WIL.**|
|9+|Exaltation. **Recover all WIL** and gain +1 free FD (max 4) for tomorrow’s Miracles.|

---

# **Lyrical Magic**

Not all magic is spoken or prayed—some is sung. **Lyrical Magic** channels emotion and story through melody. Bards, minstrels, and wanderers weave songs that echo with real power.

## **Learning Songs**

Learning a song is a **Complex Task**, measured in days. Each day of study requires hearing, performing, or meditating on it. The Warden determines the number of **Steps** based on complexity.

## **Performance Rules**

- Singing takes a **full turn**
- Roll a **WIL Save**: You must roll **≤ WIL** and **> song complexity**
- On failure, gain **1 Fatigue**
- Singing or reciting at least **four lines** fitting the song reduces its complexity by 3 (minimum 0)
- The singer must be **heard** by the target and **see** them
- Songs end immediately if the singer attacks or is attacked in melee

## **Song Repertoire**

### **Combat Songs**
**Song of the Hearth (1)** — A warm tune of home and kinship. Allies become immune to fear and automatically pass Morale checks until the end of battle.

**Song of Slaying (1)** — A rousing battle shanty. For one round, allies gain +1 Bonus Damage against a chosen creature type.

**Song of Iron (3)** — A fierce anthem of weapon and war. For the rest of the battle, the chosen weapon rolls an extra damage die.

### **Exploration Songs**
**Song of Vigilance (2)** — A rhythmic chant of watchfulness. The party cannot be ambushed for the next 10 minutes (one exploration turn).

**Song of Silent Passing (2)** — A quiet melody of escape. The next travel Event roll uses **two dice**, and the party picks the better result.

**Song of Light Feet (2)** — A tune of steady rhythm. Prevents Fatigue from climbing, exhaustion, or travel strain during the next exploration segment.

**Song of All Seasons (3)** — A long song of the turning year. Reduces weather penalties by one tier.

### **Special Songs**
**Song of Woe (5)** — A sorrowful lament. When sung in hardship, all listeners recover **1d6 Fatigue**, but the singer becomes **Deprived** until resting properly. Only works when the party is in true peril.

**Song of Goodbye (1)** — A funeral song for the fallen. Allows the player of a deceased character to deliver final words through the lyrics.
