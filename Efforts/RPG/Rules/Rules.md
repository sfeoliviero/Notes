### Dice and Rolls

The game primarily uses ten-sided dice, commonly referred to as **d10s**. Each player should have at least two of these dice. Some ten-sided dice are numbered from 0 to 9, while others are numbered from 1 to 10. **In the case of 0-9 dice, a roll of 0 counts as 10.**

---
## Stats

There are four stats, that range from $2$ to $8$.
- **Might**: Represents physical strength and power.
- **Agility**: Represents speed, dexterity, and quickness.
- **Knowledge**: Represents intelligence, wisdom, and knowledge.
- **Willpower**: Represents mental strength, determination, and resilience.
### Motifs

As an adventurer, you have lived a life full of experiences and gained various skills and affiliations. These are represented by dice ranging from **d4** to **d10**. **Unlike traditional systems, the lower the die, the greater your skill or affinity in that area.** For example, a **d4** represents mastery, while a **d10** represents inexperience or unpredictability. This mechanic reflects your character’s unique background and expertise.

### Rolls

Whenever an adventurer or other creature in the game attempts a task with an uncertain outcome—such as attacking a foe, sneaking behind guards, or attempting to persuade someone—they must make a roll.

#### Making a Roll

When you make a roll, pick a relevant attribute and roll two ten-sided dice (**2d10**). The outcomes of these dice determine how successful your roll is. Here’s how the tiers work:

- **Tier 1 (Failure):** If you roll two dice **higher than** the relevant attribute, this is the worst outcome. If using an ability, the outcome is minimal. If performing a test, the outcome is a failure.
- **Tier 2 (Partial Success):** If you roll one die **lower than** the relevant attribute and one **higher than** it, you have a moderate impact when using an ability. For a test, you achieve success but at some cost.
- **Tier 3 (Success):** If you roll two dice **lower than** the relevant attribute, you have a great impact when using an ability. For a test, you achieve success.

#### Critical Success and Failure

- Rolling a **1** on a die allows you to roll another **d10**. If this subsequent roll is **higher than the relevant attribute**, you discard it. If it is **lower than or equal to the attribute**, your tier improves: from Tier 1 to Tier 2, or from Tier 2 to Tier 3. If you were already at Tier 3, you achieve a **critical success**, meaning the task succeeds with an additional bonus effect.
- Rolling a **10** has the opposite effect. You must roll another **d10**, and if this roll is **higher than the relevant attribute**, your tier worsens. If it is **lower than or equal to the attribute**, you discard it.

#### Favor

Sometimes, you may find yourself in a situation where you have an edge over a task. In such cases, you gain **favor**, meaning you roll an additional die and pick the best result.

#### Disfavor

Other times, things may not work in your favor. In these cases, you suffer **disfavor**, meaning you roll an additional die and pick the worst result.

#### Tests

When an adventurer attempts a task that typically requires a test, they must roll on an appropriate attribute. If you have a relevant motif, you can roll the motif die alongside the **2d10** and pick the **two best results**. The DM picks a difficulty level for the task (Easy, Medium, Hard) and determines if the test succeeds based on the outcome.

### Deprivation & Fatigue

A Player Character deprived of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their **physical inventory**, one for each day. Each **Fatigue** occupies one slot and lasts until the PC has recovered through sleep or food. PCs can also gain **Fatigue** by blocking and dodging, casting spells, or from events in the fiction.

---

### Damage, Injury & Death

#### Environmental Damage

The main source of damage to Player Characters is likely to be combat, though the environment, weather, and traps can also cause harm.

- If a source of damage can be reasonably defended against (e.g., a weapon attack, darts from a trap), the damage is applied to **HP first**.
- If a source of damage cannot be defended against (e.g., poison, a fall, fire, cold weather), the damage is applied **directly to the relevant Ability**:
    - **MGT** is damaged by wounds and injuries.
    - **AGI** is damaged by sprains, poisons, and shocks.
    - **WIL** is damaged by fear, psychic attacks, and extreme mental strain.
    - **KNOW** is damaged by wounds and injuries.

When damage is applied to an Ability, determine whether it could reduce the Ability to 0 or is from a particularly dangerous source. If so, the player must roll a **Critical Damage Save** after taking the damage.

#### Critical Damage Save

A **Critical Damage Save** is like a normal test, but failing has serious effects:

- Failing a **MGT** save inflicts an injury (see below). **0 MGT means death.**
- Failing an **AGI** save or reaching **0 AGI** immobilizes/unconsciousness the PC.
- Failing a **WIL** save or reaching **0 WIL** debilitated/unconsciousness the PC.

When suffering **Critical Damage to STR**, roll **1d10** to determine the injured area:


|1d10|Result|Example|
|---|---|---|
|1-5|Torso|Lose an additional 1d4 STR.|
|6|Left Leg|Lose 1d4 DEX, potential loss of leg.|
|7|Right Leg|Lose 1d4 DEX, potential loss of leg.|
|8|Left Arm|Drop held item, attacks impaired due to injury, potential loss of arm.|
|9|Right Arm|Drop held item, attacks impaired due to injury, potential loss of arm.|
|10|Head|Roll 1d6. On a 1-3, die. On a 4-5, lose an eye. On a 6, gain a cool scar.|

**Aftermath:** Add a severe wound to the character’s **physical inventory**, e.g., _Severe Sword Wound (Right Leg)_.

#### Wounds & How to Treat Them

Some types of damage leave wounds, which hinder adventurers more than simple damage. Wounds occupy a slot in the **physical inventory** and come in 3 levels:

- **Light Wounds:** Can be healed in the field with proper medicine.
- **Severe Wounds:** Require serious medical attention, likely between adventures.
- **Permanent Wounds:** Cannot be healed. Each permanent wound lowers a fitting Attribute by -1 (e.g., WIS for nerve damage). The **inventory slot is permanently occupied**.

Wounds encourage adventure: curing them can tie into the **Complex Task system**.

#### Disease

Diseases can be contracted from foes or environmental hazards. A disease damages an Ability every day unless a successful **MGT Save** is made. Some diseases require multiple saves to heal. Most diseases last only a limited time. Rest and care allow the **MGT Save** to be made with **favor** (roll twice, pick the best result). A cure can remedy a disease without saves.

**Example Diseases:**

- **Swampsigh:** Lasts 1d4 days. 1 MGT damage on a failed save. Sickly green complexion.
- **Bonebreaker Plague:** Lasts indefinitely. 2 MGT damage on a failed save. Requires 3 successful saves to heal. Muscles deteriorate, bones become brittle.
- **Tick Jitters:** Lasts 1d6 days. 1d2 AGI damage on a failed save. Sudden spasms.
- **Shadowrot:** Lasts indefinitely. 2 AGI damage on a failed save. Requires 4 successful saves to heal. Black blemishes all over the body.
- **Mindfog Fever:** Lasts 1d4 days. 1 WIL damage on a failed save. Forgetfulness, confusion.
- **Soul’s Despair:** Lasts indefinitely. 1d4 WIL damage on a failed save. Hallucinations, hopelessness.

#### Healing & Recovery
##### Catching Your Breath
Resting for a few moments (out of combat) and having a drink of water restores lost HP but might leave the party exposed. Water is kept in a waterskin, which occupies 1 slot. Fully filled, it has a Usage Die of D8. Whenever a character recovers HP, they roll the waterskin’s Usage Die. On a 1 or 2, the die decreases in size (d8>d6>d4). On a 1-2 on a d4, the waterskin is empty.

##### Sleep
Staying awake all night leaves you Deprived. The quality of sleep determines benefits granted:

| Types of rest | Example                                                      | Effect                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None          | Travelling, studying or exploring all night                  | Deprived                                                            |
| Perilous      | A fortified room in a dungeon, a makeshift camp in  blizzard | Not Deprived                                                        |
| Normal        | Well-made camp in the wilderness, a simple inn               | Not Deprived, removes all Fatigue                                   |
| Comfortable   | A luxurious chamber                                          | Not Deprived, removes all Fatigue, restore Ability Score Loss by 1. |
##### Food & Meals
An adventurer must eat at least once a day to not become Deprived. All meals listed below prevent Deprivation. Beyond that, high-quality meals can restore Fatigue, an invaluable property in dungeons.

Desperate meals are things only eaten when in dire need of food, such as raw meat, raw fish, snakes, treefrogs, rats, etc. WIL Save to not puke it up.
Fresh meals consist of foraged fruits and vegetables that are otherwise not prepared.
Simple meals are ingredients that have seen some basic level of preparation, such as grilled meat and roasted vegetables. Restores 1 Fatigue. Requires fire. Rations also count as a simple meal.
Fancy meals are multiple prepared ingredients put together, such as boiled vegetables with grilled fish, boar meat sandwiches, etc. This restores all Fatigue. Requires fire and a cooking pot.
More information about gathering ingredients can be found in the Gathering section.

##### Wildcrafting
Wildcrafting allows one to craft healing salves, teas, tonics, and potions with ingredients found in the wild.

Ingredients for wildcrafting can be found while foraging and consist of mushrooms, mosses, plants, roots, bark, and saps. Ingredients can be Common, Uncommon, and Rare. (See Complex Tasks for more.) An ingredient’s rarity decides its Potency: 1 for Common, 2 for Uncommon, and 4 for Rare. Furthermore, ingredients are defined by the type of region they are gathered from, like Plains, Forest, Swamp, Hills, Mountain, or Desert.

An example ingredient could be “Hallowoak Bark, Uncommon, Plains.”

Each recipe has a Potency that must be met by combining ingredients. Each recipe must contain at least 2 different ingredients, and some recipes have requirements for region, such as “Swamp 1+,” which means that at least one ingredient must be from a swamp region.

Some example recipes:

Healing Salve. Restores 1d3 MGT or KNOW if applied before 8 hours of rest. Potency: 4
Musclesoothe Mixture. Restores 1D3 AGI if applied before 8 hours of rest. Potency: 4
Dreamweed Tea. Restores 1D3 WIL if applied before 8 hours of rest. Potency: 4
Sleeping Tonic. Grants an exceptional night of sleep, “upgrading” the type of rest by 1 level (Perilous => Normal => Comfortable). Potency: 4
Coldroot Salve. Cures Light Burns in the field. Potency: 3. Hills: 1+
Herbal Antidote. Cures Light Poisoning in the field. Potency: 3. Swamp: 1+
Emberglow Tea. Cures Light Frostbite in the field. Potency: 3. Desert: 1+
Ironroot Brew. A tea with the strange properties of making joints stiffer at will. The PC is harder to disarm, and climbing becomes easier for 1 day. Potency: 4. Hills: 2+
Bitterbark Chew. This bitter mixture is surprisingly healthy. It staves off hunger (counting as a Simple Meal) and helps with indigestion. Potency: 4
#### Recovering Ability Score Loss
Ability Score Loss can be recovered by comfortable rest (see above), but can also be used as a prompt for roleplaying and exploration:

MGT and KNOW score losses represents wounds, scrapes, cuts, or bruises. Recovery can be hastened by visiting a healer, physician, clinic, etc., for 1d4 recovery per day.
AGI score loss represents sprains, cramp, or muscle ache. Recovery can be hastened by visiting a spa, massage parlor, bath house, etc., for 1d4 recovery per day.
WIL score loss represents mental strain, low morale, or lack of focus. Recovery can be hastened by socializing, relaxing, performing a tea ritual, meditation, prayer, etc., for 1d4 recovery per day.
