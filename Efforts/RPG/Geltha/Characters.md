1.  Drystan was born in the slums of **Aquilae**, a vast coastal city where iron, smoke, and salt ruled the air. He never knew his parents. Some said they died in the shipyards, others that they simply vanished into the alleys of the lower docks. What he did know was the man who found him—**Magister Corvin**, an old ship artillerist whose back was bent from decades of recoil and cannonfire.
	Corvin took the boy in, not out of kindness, but because he needed hands small enough to crawl through gun decks and oil the machinery. Drystan learned quickly. By the time most children were still playing in the streets, he could clean, load, and fire a deck gun without supervision. He served aboard Corvin’s vessel, the _Gladius Ventorum_, as a ship’s boy, sleeping among ropes and barrels, always listening to the rhythm of gears and gunpowder.
	Over time, fascination replaced fear. The way heat, pressure, and steel came together to unleash controlled chaos enthralled him. With scraps from the shipyard, Drystan began building tiny mechanisms—wind-up mice, spark-throwing flints, even a crude pistol powered by compressed air. The crew mocked him, calling him “little artificer,” but Corvin saw promise and began teaching him the finer arts of calculation and craft.
**Motif:** Young sailor. 

2. When he grew older, Drystan left the ship and tried to make something of himself ashore. He sought apprenticeship in the Guild of Artificers, hoping to turn his restless talent into a respectable craft. But life among polished workshops and measured routines did not suit him. His ideas were too strange, his methods too reckless. He experimented with unstable alloys, mixed forbidden reagents, and spoke of designs that made his masters uneasy.
	One evening, after a heated argument over a failed demonstration that nearly leveled part of the workshop, fists and tempers flared. Drystan struck his overseer, and the guild cast him out before dawn.
	Since then, he has drifted between workshops and shipyards, a rogue craftsman with a genius for invention and a record that no guild will forgive. His hands still bear the burns of his work, and his mind still burns brighter than any forge in Aquilae.
**Motif:** Quarrelsome engineer
3. Having failed to make a life as a respected engineer and inventor, Drystan turned his restless mind elsewhere. His talent for creation, unfit for conventional work, found its only outlet in a life most deemed reckless: the career of an adventurer. With no other path, he took to exploring the wilds, delving into ruins, and wandering distant lands—each journey a chance to test his ingenuity and gather inspiration for ever more daring inventions. The world itself became his workshop, and every encounter, trap, and hidden artifact a spark for new ideas.
