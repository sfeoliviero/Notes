1. We need an equivalent four order operation on our objects. 
## Notes 
1. The state is written as a function of only four term interaction terms. Let us assume for sake of simplicity they commute, then we can write everything as products of quartic commuting interactions. 
2. I can consider all the products of commuting four terms, they have 2 or 0 overlap between each other.
